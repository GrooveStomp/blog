<p>After lunch today I made a visit to a local boardgame store just to see what was
new.  The local gamestore near my place is much cheaper, but has a drastically
different selection, so it&rsquo;s always nice to see what else is available.</p>

<p>There were two notable games on today&rsquo;s visit:</p>

<ul>
<li>Agricola: Family Edition</li>
<li>Android: Mainframe</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen mention of Agricola: Family Edition before, so that was neat to see in
person.  I watched a Tom Vasel review of it, and I think I would still prefer to
play Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small.</p>

<p>Onto the other game; Android: Mainframe is completely new on my radar.  A quick
read on the back says:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two Player</li>
<li>Strategy Boardgame</li>
<li>&lt; 30 min. play time</li>
</ul>

<p>This sounds absolutely fantastic!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read two text reviews on Boardgamegeek, and unfortunately this game looks
like a dud.  I think this is really interesting, because I&rsquo;ve been seriously
thinking about Android: Netrunner a lot lately.  It&rsquo;s a game that I think is
really interestingly broken.  I won&rsquo;t go into all the details here; I&rsquo;ll just
say that I&rsquo;ve written pages of notes on it and am trying to identify what I like
in the original design.</p>

<p>I was excited to see this two player strategic boardgame in the Android universe
because there seems to be a large crossover with my thinking on Android:
Netrunner.  Things I would have liked to have seen in this version:</p>

<ul>
<li>Retain the theme.</li>
<li>Make the theme far more accessible.
The theme should aid understanding and make the mechanics intuitive.
Android: Netrunner horrendously fails at this.</li>
<li>Retain asymmetric roles.</li>
<li>Remove output randomness.</li>
<li>Remove out-of-band deck construction.</li>
<li>Much more!</li>
</ul>

<p>A quick glance makes it obvious that none of this applies to Android: Mainframe.
This game is simply a rethemed version of Bauhaus<sup><a
href="#2017-05-17_ref1">1</a></sup> with some random elements added via your
&ldquo;powers&rdquo; in your hand.</p>

<p>Bauhaus looks pretty fun, but I think the attempt to theme it and add random
elements probably subverts the basic game. Oh well.  I guess this is good
motivation to keep doing my thinking and planning on an Android: Netrunner
influenced game design of my own! :-)</p>
