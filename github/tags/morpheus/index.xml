      <description>Have you ever heard of suckless1? I think I stumbled onto suckless sometime while reading K. Mandla2, though there&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable chance it might have happened before then. suckless immediately resonated with me because of their philosophy3. Their software also looks good, very accurately reflecting the idea of minimalism4; often requiring you to rethink how you typically interact with software to do what you want to do. Sometimes this process of re-evaluation is fruitful, sometimes maybe less so, but it&amp;rsquo;s always interesting to experience.</description>
