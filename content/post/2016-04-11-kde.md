So, it turns out I like KDE.

I use Ubuntu a lot.  It's installed on all of my computers and it's the server OS I've used
at work for the past five or so years.  Typically I stick with Unity on the desktop.
There are a few reasons why I opted to change: I like to try new things, I get bored,
I haven't used KDE in a while.  It's hard to say exactly.  A few strong contenders:
I was rather impressed with Kdbg recently and started using that in all my C projects. I've
been using Manjaro, and on my more powerful machines I opted for the default distro which
includes KDE.  Rich Geldreich told me to use it.<sup><a href="#2016-04-11_ref1">1</a></sup>

I had been using it for a few weeks and ran into similar issues with regards to multiple
monitors and screen locking, so I opted back to Unity.  Well, here I am switching right back
to KDE and it is definitely a much more comfortable, possibly more intuitive UI.

So there you have it.  I apparently like KDE.
