      <description>The main application at work was developed in Ruby on Rails, with supporting services written in Java and PHP. We&amp;rsquo;ve recently rewritten the PHP service in Java, but haven&amp;rsquo;t fully deprecated the old PHP code yet. All of our applications and services run on Amazon&amp;rsquo;s AWS.
Going forward we will be trying to gut our monolithic app into many services, and we&amp;rsquo;re using Vert.x as the underlying technology core to do that.</description>
