    <p>Just finished off the night with two rounds of LOTR:LCG followed by base Onirim.</p>

<p>LOTR:LCG, man. There are definitely a lot of complex interactions in those cards and lots of things to think about when playing.  I know I am underutilizing Beravor&rsquo;s 2-card draw ability.  I guess that comes with exposure, though.</p>

<p>Onirim is nice.  I&rsquo;ve won the base game the last two times I&rsquo;ve played it now, so I know it&rsquo;s time to move on to the expansions.  I started reading through them before playing tonight, but there are 7 of them! Â I was already procrastinating catching up on Betrayal at House on the Hill for tomorrow night&rsquo;s gaming session, so I sure as heck wasn&rsquo;t going to be spending that time productively learning a new expansion or anything like that. :-)</p>
