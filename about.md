  Hi, I'm Aaron Oman.  My online handle is GrooveStomp.
</div>

I like programming, videogames, the great outdoors and I love my family.

In terms of software, I am a huge language geek.  Lisps, stack-based languages,
functional languages; static typing, dynamic typing, strong typing, weak typing;
concurrency, parallelism; parsing, datastructures - any one of these topics
is a rich field of research and I like it all.

Beyond more academic pursuits like language development, I am significantly interested
in privacy and security.  There are huge gains to be made in terms of ease of use
for broader adoption of privacy and security standards like PGP encryption of email,
OTR messaging, full disk encryption and encrypted calls.

Professionally I try to exemplify those principles that I value most.  This includes
being courteous and honest, clearly communicating with all peers, and acting fairly and directly
regardless of title or experience.
