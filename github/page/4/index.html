    GOG is having an &ldquo;up to 85%&rdquo; off sale for their Witcher series of games. I already have The Witcher 1 and 2, but they&rsquo;re also offering The Witcher Adventure Game. I was part of the beta, but didn&rsquo;t have an opportunity to play it, and only attempted to play the demo a couple of times. I found the tutorial wasn&rsquo;t particularly elucidating and just let it be. I&rsquo;ve been curious about the boardgame for some time, but don&rsquo;t know anybody who&rsquo;s played it, and haven&rsquo;t seen it come up very often in any boardgame discussions.

    I decided to give it another go. I played the following setup:  Scheme: Secret Invasion of the Skrull Shapeshifters Mastermind: Magneto Henchmen: Savage Land Mutates Heroes: Captain America, Hulk, Deadpool  I think that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s important. The Scheme says to use 6 heroes and put 12 hero cards into the villain deck. This conflicts with Solo rules which state to use 3 heroes, so I just halved the number of hero cards to add to the villain deck to 6.

    As any reader of this blog is probably aware, I started playing Dice Masters a short while ago. Coincidentally, the second Avengers movie was released within the last two weeks and I had the opportunity to watch that with a friend. I am absolutely certain that this confluence of events has left me thinking about Marvel Legendary.
The Legendary games from Upper Deck are well regarded. I first started getting into them either as a result of watching tons of reviews of boardgames, or as a result of being super interested in deckbuilding games and then watching a bunch of reviews of boardgames.

    During a slight bit of downtime today I separated my Dice Masters decks back into the cards that came with the starter set and those that didn&rsquo;t. My Dice Masters gaming buddy came over, and instead of Dice Masters, we played two games of Race for the Galaxy!
My buddy has soundly beat me the last three games of Dice Masters that we&rsquo;ve played. That&rsquo;s great since we now know he has graduated well past the student phase, but it&rsquo;s also illustrated some parts of Dice Masters that neither of us are super keen about.

    Wow.
So I just tallied my score and got -1. I may have miscounted. We can say -7 if we want to err on the safe side. Either way I&rsquo;m super happy about it. My last score was -23 or so. There&rsquo;s been a steady progression with every game I&rsquo;ve played. This time I was able to make it to the third phase whereas my previous best was only part way through the second phase.

    I just wrapped up two rounds of Onirim. I aborted the first one because it was obvious I couldn&rsquo;t win, and I realized I hadn&rsquo;t been following all of the rules. I decided to just start playing through the expansions one-by-one and see how it works. Tonight was the first expansion: The Book of Steps Lost and Found. There&rsquo;s a mechanic where you can cast &ldquo;spells&rdquo; that aid you, and I simply wasn&rsquo;t doing that at all.

    It&rsquo;s always been my intention to pick up The Gathering Storm if I picked up Race for the Galaxy because of its solo support. Well, today I completed that transaction and also managed to finish my first playthrough of the real, physical copy of RftG. I played against the easy robot, and I won! 43-32, in fact. That may actually be my largest win to date.
It was interesting. Playing against Keldon&rsquo;s AI sure streamlines playing the game.

    The reddit thread.
My contribution.
Reproduced here:  Friday: Such a great solo game. I&rsquo;m steadily improving, but also not playing it as much as I&rsquo;d like. Partially because of all the other great games out there, but also because it&rsquo;s surprisingly intense.
Pandemic: The Cure: Such a great game. I recently rated this as my only 10&frasl;10 game on the appropriate /r/boardgames thread. Played it with my neighbor at the local gamestore yesterday and he loved it.

    I just finished my third real playthrough of this highly rated single player game. My score this time? -23. That&rsquo;s a solid progression!  Playthrough 1: -50 Playthrough 2: -42 Playthrough 3: -23  I definitely felt like I was making better decisions this time, too. I also noticed a few spots where I can focus my attention next time.
Man, such a great solo game. A bit intense, though; I find it difficult to play it multiple times in succession.
