    Through the magic of Wine (specifically the PlayOnLinux variant) I&rsquo;m now able to play RFTG on my Ubuntu machine from System 76. Oh happy day! :-)

    I know what the next game I am going to buy &ldquo;for me&rdquo; is going to be. Apparently Roll for the Galaxy is a more friendly iteration of the game. At least Tom Vasel and Sam Healey think so. I can&rsquo;t speak to that, though. I&rsquo;ve been playing the Keldon AI to learn the game, and I must say: I am hooked. I started last night and couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about it.

    I picked up Bang! The Dice Game at Strategies two weeks ago while browsing for Fiasco and Savage Worlds. I&rsquo;ve really been looking forward to playing it since, but the opportunity simply wasn&rsquo;t available until today. I booked a conference room and four of us got together over lunch to play three bouts. It&rsquo;s a nice game; simple to comprehend, plays quickly and offers opportunities for subterfuge. It seems like it would really start to shine with 5 players, and may be best with the upper limit it supports of 8 players.

    My favourite part of D&amp;D to date has been pouring over resources and thinking up a backstory for my character.
I don&rsquo;t have a long history with tabletop RPGs other than being interested in D&amp;D for many, many years. In 2014 I was lucky enough to have coworkers who were interested in playing, as well as a wonderful GM. We started a D&amp;D 4th edition party. That was a good experience, but something about it didn&rsquo;t really feel right to me; it wasn&rsquo;t particularly engaging and the game felt repetitive.

    I just finished my first legitimate game of Friday. -50 points.
At one point I understood the game would be difficult, but I must have just glossed over that detail. There may be a little masochist living inside me who jumps for joy at the thought of things like Dark Souls and 1001 Spikes. Certainly I can appreciate those things, but I&rsquo;m not sure if I outright enjoy them&hellip;
When I first read through the rules, I immediately attempted a playthrough.

    I&rsquo;ve really been struggling with Shadowrun: Crossfire. I love the theme to death and the mechanics work nicely. There&rsquo;s just something off about it. For one thing, it&rsquo;s punishingly hard; I&rsquo;ve played 8 times and lost every single one. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter whether I&rsquo;m playing single player, two player or three. (Haven&rsquo;t tried four yet.) The best progress I&rsquo;ve made was playing four runners solo.
I&rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of reworking the game.

    Casey Muratori started Handmade Hero. It&rsquo;s his project to teach C programming to beginners by building a game from scratch using the most minimal subset of operating system calls possible. I&rsquo;ve been attending as many of the live streams as I can, and the whole project fills me with excitement. Earlier this year Mike Acton gave a talk at CppCon titled Data Oriented Design and C++. I watched this video and watched it again, and again and again.

    I am super excited to announce that I have started working at Mogo Financial. Mogo is doing really interesting things in the Canadian financial market and I am proud to be a part of it.
My title is officially Senior Software Developer, though I have a lot of learning and growing to do.
I look forward to working with my new team and the challenges we will be facing.

    As my blog has become neglected, I&rsquo;ve had ample time to contemplate my approach to writing. When I reflect on my habits it is clear that I haven&rsquo;t been directing my attention and energy where they could most effectively be applied.
Not all of my thinking has been negative or quasi-constructive, though; some of it has been generative. As an example, I&rsquo;ve really been wanting to write about computer graphics. The scope of what I want has changed wildly from a few simple one-off C++ programs to a strongly-typed Haskell-style rendering and animation engine written in C++.

    The main application at work was developed in Ruby on Rails, with supporting services written in Java and PHP. We&rsquo;ve recently rewritten the PHP service in Java, but haven&rsquo;t fully deprecated the old PHP code yet. All of our applications and services run on Amazon&rsquo;s AWS.
Going forward we will be trying to gut our monolithic app into many services, and we&rsquo;re using Vert.x as the underlying technology core to do that.
