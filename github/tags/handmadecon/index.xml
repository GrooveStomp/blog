      <description>HandmadeCon 2016 is just around the corner! I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to go! The speaker lineup looks absolutely stellar this year.  Besides that, I&amp;rsquo;ve obviously been keeping myself busy for a few months here with nary an update. The most visible change to anyone who might read this blog is that I&amp;rsquo;ve completely revamped my hosting situation; both making great progress on my goal of being entirely self-hosted, and for serving up content via HTTPS to you.</description>
