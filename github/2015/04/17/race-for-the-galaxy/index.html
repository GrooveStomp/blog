    <p>I know what the next game I am going to buy &ldquo;for me&rdquo; is going to be.  Apparently <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/132531/roll-galaxy">Roll for the Galaxy</a> is a more friendly iteration of the game.  At least <a href="https://youtu.be/-Z3H0H4WXeU?t=694">Tom Vasel and Sam Healey</a> think so.  I can&rsquo;t speak to that, though.  I&rsquo;ve been playing the <a href="http://keldon.net/rftg/">Keldon AI</a> to learn the game, and I must say: I am hooked.  I started last night and couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about it.  All day at work today it was on my mind.  My local game store has open boardgaming on Thursdays, so I hopped over and cracked the open box of <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143/race-galaxy">RFTG</a> - just setting up the play area and looking through all the components.  After the store closed, I came back home and booted up the Keldon AI again for a few more rounds.</p>

<p>The theme really does it for me.  The artwork, at first, really turned me off.  Now I quite like it.  It&rsquo;s a little pulpy, but also very functional and the images really set the theme well.  I just want to buy it up now.  Actually, I want to buy a bunch of card sleeves for it.  Actually, I have a couple of Amazon orders to pick up first.  Let&rsquo;s just pop that stack and then I&rsquo;ll have my whatever stuff it is I ordered from Amazon, my new sleeves, and Race for the Galaxy complete with <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/34499/race-galaxy-gathering-storm">The Gathering Storm expansion</a> for solo play.  Ah yes, living in this hypothetical future world is wonderful.</p>

<p>The only downside is that the game isn&rsquo;t straight forward to learn - at least not without owning the actual game itself, nor the rulebook.  I&rsquo;m curious how easily Daniela will be able to pick it up.  Then, of course, there is the option of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/32tf73/have_you_ever_been_marooned_on_an_island_britain/cqej7t3">cooperative solo play</a>, where we jointly make decisions on how to proceed.  That might work well until she grasps the gameplay concepts fully enough that we can start playing competitively&hellip; and then, of course, I&rsquo;ll want to play with my brothers at holidays&hellip; <em>sigh</em>.  Better get started! :-)</p>
