I recently went through part of a job interview.  It was interesting.

I had a few calls with different folks within the organization and those were
generally good.  Work history, ambitions, etc.  This was all fairly typical
stuff.

Ultimately I wound up simply not responding to the company.

So what happened?

At this point you've read the title, so you know the answer.  They gave me a
take-home coding challenge.

Now, I'm not ideologically opposed to take-home challenges but this particular
example raised a large red flag for me.  Here are a couple of guidelines in case
you think you want to use a take-home coding challenge at your organization:

- It really cannot require more than just an hour or two of work.
  Anything longer requires compensation pay.  Additionally, some of us simply
  don't have much spare time to commit to working on projects in which we have
  no interest and there is no indication that it will be worthwhile.

- Give reasonable time expectations.
  This coding challenge was described as requiring roughly 10 hours of work, and
  they expected to see it in 2-3 days, or one week at most.
  If you don't know why that's absolutely ridiculous, then you deserve the
  resulting applicants that you attract.

Around a year ago I went through the entire interview process at another
company. That company made similar mistakes and several other, far worse
ones along the way.  I might get into that in a later post.
