    <p>I decided to give it another go.  I played the following setup:
<ul>
    <li>Scheme: Secret Invasion of the Skrull Shapeshifters</li>
    <li>Mastermind: Magneto</li>
    <li>Henchmen: Savage Land Mutates</li>
    <li>Heroes: Captain America, Hulk, Deadpool</li>
</ul>
I think that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s important.  The Scheme says to use 6 heroes and put 12 hero cards into the villain deck.  This conflicts with Solo rules which state to use 3 heroes, so I just halved the number of hero cards to add to the villain deck to 6.  Otherwise I used the same rules.</p>

<p>My final score was 2.  I did win. It actually felt pretty close.  It didn&rsquo;t have the same feel of tension that I remember Legendary Encounters giving me, but there was a better sense of tension than I got from the last playthrough.  Unfortunately, I really think Vassal works against the experience here, with its clunky interface.  I also think part of it is inherent to the design of the Legendary system, though.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure here.  I&rsquo;m lukewarm on Marvel Legendary.  I&rsquo;ll probably pass on it until I have the opportunity to play in person with some other folks.</p>
