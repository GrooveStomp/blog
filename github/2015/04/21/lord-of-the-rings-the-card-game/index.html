    <p>Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, a.k.a Lord of the Rings: LCG, a.k.a LOTR:LCG - which is how I&rsquo;ll refer to it from now on.</p>

<p>This game&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know about it.  I was really excited to get my copy after having read a lot about how it&rsquo;s a great game to play solo.  One thing you&rsquo;re not told is how the core set isn&rsquo;t very good for solo play, and how only one of the three included missions is even beatable if you play solo.  Oh, apparently the second mission <strong>can</strong> be beaten solo, but it&rsquo;s very much luck of the draw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luck of the draw.&rdquo;  That&rsquo;s a pretty accurate description for my experience with this game so far.  The game feels like it can be <strong>very</strong> draw-dependent, like Shadowrun: Crossfire, though a little less severe.  There are a lot of combinations of decks to build for LOTR:LCG, though; so perhaps I just need to do some more experimentation.  I&rsquo;ve played with the 30-card leadership deck, the 40-card custom deck from <a href="https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/beorns-path/">Beorn&rsquo;s Path</a>, and the 30-card fighting (combat?) deck.  I&rsquo;ve only had any good luck at all with the leadership deck.  In my last play I drew Ungoliant&rsquo;s Spawn as the second encounter&hellip;  This was compounded my having absolutely terrible questing abilities, so my threat continually raised in every round.  At least it was over quickly.</p>

<p>Argh.  I really wanted to like this game, but it seems like it requires a significant out-of-band investment to be worthwhile.  It really makes me appreciate deck builders even more.  I sincerely hope it grows on me and I end up loving it; I&rsquo;m just really skeptical of that happening now - especially with so many games on my wanted list and relatively little time to dedicate to learning optimal gaming strategies for this one specific game.</p>
