      <description>I finally took the opportunity to jump back into RISC-V, Go and QEMU as a followup to my previous exploration.1
I had a difficult time understanding exactly what was required to run my compiled Go program in QEMU. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the instructions.2
 Compile and run in qemu-riscv64 (which is expected to be in PATH):
$ GOARCH=riscv GOOS=linux go run ../riscvtest/add.go  Build:
$ GOARCH=riscv GOOS=linux go build .</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted here. So what&amp;rsquo;s up?
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working at Lendesk in a team lead / senior developer role and trying to pursue my interest in Go and Linux. This has been a very tricky path to navigate as work has abandoned any pretense of plans to adopt Go and all work machines are MacOS. Thankfully, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to carve out some personal time to keep poking around in my area of interest.</description>
