## Personal Summary

I value candor and strive to exemplify it, both professionally and personally.
I have plenty of room to grow. :-)

I am an avid fan of computing history and love learning about computers,
operating systems, networking, computer graphics and videogames.

My current hobby is weight training and nutrition.  I've added 80lbs to my bench
press in the past 8 months.  I've lost 10lbs
and have gone through significant body recomposition.

I also enjoy programming.  These days the majority of my programming is probably
done in Bash for configuring and scripting my desktop environments.  Beyond that
I'm primarily using Ruby professionally, Go sometimes professionally and
sometimes for hobby purposes, and some variant of plain C for personal projects;
often C99.

## Programming Projects
- [Daily Programming Practice](https://code.groovestomp.com/practice/tree/)  
  After the first HandmadeCon I was motivated to try a little dabble of
  programming every day.  I have long since stopped doing that, but I still use
  that repo to explore new projects on occasion.

- [Software Renderer](https://code.groovestomp.com/software-renderer/tree/)  
  I decided to do a "clean-room" implementation of a software renderer to
  replicate what it might have been like as a graphics/game programmer in the
  early/mid 1990s.

- [C Parser](https://code.groovestomp.com/cparser/tree/)  
  HandmadeHero and The Jeff and Casey Show motivated me to start exploring
  making my own language and development tools.  This is the first bit of that
  exploration.  I decided to start designing a new language based on a
  foundation of C.  This is my hand-written recursive-descent parser written in
  C.

- [Personal C Library](https://code.groovestomp.com/gslibc/tree)  
  I started doing a lot more hobby programming in C.  C has a really weak
  standard library, so you always end up rolling your own.  This is intended to
  be along the lines of [gingerBill's
  libraries](https://github.com/gingerBill/gb) or the [stb
  libraries](https://github.com/nothings/stb).

- [Config-file Precompiler](https://code.groovestomp.com/gscfg/tree/)  
  For one project I really wanted to have a yaml-style configuration file but
  not have to do dynamic memory allocations or runtime parsing of the config
  file to use the data.  My solution was to build a precompiler which generates
  a .c file for inclusion into your source tree.
