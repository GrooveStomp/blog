HandmadeCon 2016 is just around the corner!<br/>
I'm really excited to go!<br/>
The [speaker lineup](https://mollyrocket.com/news_0046.html) looks absolutely stellar this year.
<p/>
Besides that, I've obviously been keeping myself busy for a few months here with nary an update.  The most visible change to anyone who might read this blog is that I've completely revamped my hosting situation; both making great progress on my goal of being entirely self-hosted, and for serving up content via HTTPS to you.<br/>
The specific implementation by which I've accomplished this is pretty interesting and has been a great opportunity to learn. I have documented a large portion of what I've done and I hope to share that here.
<p />
Short and simple. Talk soon.
