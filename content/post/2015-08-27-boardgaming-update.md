I don't recall if I've ever explicitly mentioned on here the 10x10 challenge for boardgaming.  I don't know it
in-depth, but what I recall is essentially to play 10 boardgames you already own 10 times within the calendar
year.  The theoretical advantage of doing this is less time spent buying new games, and more time spent playing
games you already own.  What a fantastic idea!  Especially for someone like me, who likes to read and research
and buy when getting into a new hobby.

So how am I doing?

As of now, here are the results:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Boardgame</th>
    <th>Number of Plays</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>Onirim</td><td>10</td></tr>
  <tr><td>VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game</td><td>3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Pandemic: The Cure</td><td>14</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Friday</td><td>4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>LOTR:LCG</td><td>7</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Escape: Curse of the Temple</td><td>9</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Ascension</td><td>4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Mage Knight</td><td>4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Dice Masters</td><td>15</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Patchwork</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Race for the Galaxy</td><td>10</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Paperback</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>

There are a few interesting things to comment on here.

- I have played a whole lot of **Ascension**, but most of it on my phone.  Probably 100 or so games.
- I got rid of **Shadowrun: Crossfire** even though I had 8 plays of it already.
- **Dice Masters** hit 15 plays within about 3 weeks of purchase, and I haven't played it since.
- **Escape: Curse of the Temple** has 9 plays, but takes only 10 minutes to play each time.
- Dee and I don't really care for **Patchwork** despite all the praise it got. It's kind of boring.

I really like the gameplay of **Dice Masters**, but really hate the collectible aspect.  I may start
playing at work with starter sets only.

I'm looking forward to playing more **Mage Knight**, but it's a really heavy game.  I would really love
to finish my custom insert for it, as I am certain I can improve setup and teardown time.  I am
pretty sure I can even do something to help with organization for solo play.

Tonight I played one round each of **Onirim** and **Race for the Galaxy** to get them up to their ten
play marks.  I really would have liked to have played some more Onirim as I tried The Tower expansion
today and I find any new set of rules typically takes a couple playthroughs to be comfortable with.
**The Tower** expansion seems like a good expansion thus far - I lost my first playthrough, so I would
say it is definitely tougher than base Onirim.  Could be luck of the draw, though; we'll see.  In
**Race for the Galaxy** I played against the AI robot with **The Gathering Storm** expansion.  I haven't
played that way in a while, so it was really slow to get going as I read the rules and warmed up to it.
The game did eventually hit a good rhythm and I beat the *easy* AI rather handily.  I probably won't
play solo again for a while (especially as I shoot to hit ten plays of other games), but I'm looking
forward to upping the difficulty and getting familiar enough with the robot AI that I rarely have to
refer to rules.

To wrap up, there are a few games I'm seriously thinking of picking up despite the 10x10 challenge.

- [Lost Cities](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/50/lost-cities)
- [Akrotiri](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/154458/akrotiri)
- [Flick 'em Up!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/169124/flick-em)

The former two have been on my wishlist for a while, but the latter two are recent.  The latter two
have been in heavy representation at [Big Pete's](http://bigpetescollectibles.blogspot.ca/) and look
interesting enough.
