I am very pleased to announce my new employment at [Commit](https://commit.dev/).
I've joined Commit full time as a senior backend software developer and am working on [Zero](https://github.com/commitdev/zero).

I am very happy with this next step on my career path.
This new position entails writing software in Go, and using Docker, Kubernetes and Terraform.
I feel like this is exactly the step I've been working towards over the last several years.

Hi Commit!
