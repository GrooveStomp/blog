I picked up <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143741/bang-dice-game">Bang! The Dice Game</a> at <a href="http://www.strategiesgames.ca/strategies/">Strategies</a> two weeks ago while browsing for <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/">Fiasco</a> and <a href="http://www.peginc.com/product-category/savage-worlds/">Savage Worlds</a>.  I've really been looking forward to playing it since, but the opportunity simply wasn't available until today.  I booked a conference room and four of us got together over lunch to play three bouts.  It's a nice game; simple to comprehend, plays quickly and offers opportunities for subterfuge.  It seems like it would really start to shine with 5 players, and may be best with the upper limit it supports of 8 players.  In the three sessions I was an outlaw all three times.  In the first two games I was the first player out, but in all three games the sheriff was out second.

I'm pretty sure now that I'm not a fan of player elimination.  It's not a big problem in this game because the game is so short, and it's even better because the first player elimination is very closely followed by the end of game; at least for lower player counts.  Still, player targeting was obviously happening and I was getting every so slightly bummed. :-)

Anyway, it is the end of the workday and I have weekend brain right now.
