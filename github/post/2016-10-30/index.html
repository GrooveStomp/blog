    <p>HandmadeCon 2016 is just around the corner!<br/>
I&rsquo;m really excited to go!<br/>
The <a href="https://mollyrocket.com/news_0046.html">speaker lineup</a> looks absolutely stellar this year.
<p/>
Besides that, I&rsquo;ve obviously been keeping myself busy for a few months here with nary an update.  The most visible change to anyone who might read this blog is that I&rsquo;ve completely revamped my hosting situation; both making great progress on my goal of being entirely self-hosted, and for serving up content via HTTPS to you.<br/>
The specific implementation by which I&rsquo;ve accomplished this is pretty interesting and has been a great opportunity to learn. I have documented a large portion of what I&rsquo;ve done and I hope to share that here.
<p />
Short and simple. Talk soon.</p>
