Hello, I am Aaron Oman.

I am a web developer with a focus on backend applications, infrastructure and tools.
I professionally develop software with Go and use AWS, Docker, Kubernetes and Terraform.

For hobby programming I use C and Zig. You can see some examples in my [personal projects](/projects/).

I have a strong personal interest in libre hardware and software, privacy and
security.  I am a big fan of [Purism](https://puri.sm/why-purism/) and
[System76](https://blog.system76.com/post/179592732883/system76-on-us-manufacturing-and-open-hardware).
I am very interested in [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/why-risc-v/).

I am inspired by [The Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and am heavily influenced by
[Casey Muratori](https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015) and [Drew DeVault](https://drewdevault.com/).  I have found [Brian Will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM&t=27s)'s videos to reflect well on my own thinking.  Given infinite time, I would dive into [Plan9](https://9p.io/plan9/about.html) and live there instead of Linux or BSD.
