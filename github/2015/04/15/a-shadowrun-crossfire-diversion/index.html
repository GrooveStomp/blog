      <h1>A Shadowrun: Crossfire diversion</h1>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve really been struggling with Shadowrun: Crossfire. I love the theme to death and the mechanics work nicely. There&rsquo;s just something off about it. For one thing, it&rsquo;s punishingly hard; I&rsquo;ve played 8 times and lost every single one. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter whether I&rsquo;m playing single player, two player or three. (Haven&rsquo;t tried four yet.) The best progress I&rsquo;ve made was playing four runners solo.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of reworking the game. I&rsquo;m leaning towards tweaking solo play specifically, but with a mind to address multiplayer as appropriate. Tonight provided an opportunity to start playing with the mechanics; unfortunately, I made very little progress. My biggest learning was perhaps that this will be a very heady endeavor and will require an alert mind, lots of time, and lots of playtesting</p>

<p>Contrast this with Friday. I had a second go at Friday after toying with Shadowrun. (-42 this time!) The mechanics in Friday feel thoroughly playtested. Shadowrun: Crossfire, on the other hand, feels unbalanced and unfinished. Shadowrun: Crossfire seems to rely very heavily on theme to compensate for its shortcomings, whereas Friday works beautifully in spite of its theme.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m honestly not even sure if I want to continue giving any time or effort to Shadowrun: Crossfire.  I&rsquo;m attracted to the challenge of making it into a great game, but there are also a lot of things fighting for my time.  Realistically I&rsquo;ll probably let it sit for a while then make another call to sell or improve it.  I imagine this is what most gamers must go through when they invest in a game that they end up not liking.  My thoughts on The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game (the LCG) are similar so far&hellip; I&rsquo;ll write about that soon.</p>
