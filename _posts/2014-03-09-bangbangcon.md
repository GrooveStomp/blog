title: Proposing a Talk for !!Con 
---

I am writing a proposal for a 10 minute "lightning talk" at [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com/).
I feel like this is a relatively _normal_ thing that **shouldn't** warrant any special writing.
But there are a couple of things that make it a very standout _thing_ for me.

1. *It is in New York.*  
Dee is super excited about the possibility of visiting New York.  I've never been before.  What an excellent excuse to go visit!

2. *I have never publicly spoken.*  
I get nervous in groups larger than around 10 people, and I suspect !!Con will be far larger than that.  Still, it's something
I've been interested in doing for years!

3. *I get to formalize my thinking on any topic of my interest.*  
I'm in the process of doing this now - jotting down ideas, trying to tease out the common threads and ultimately just
writing a focused, interesting talk.  I'll try to use funny pictures, too.

I found out about this whole thing because I follow [@b0rk](https://twitter.com/b0rk) on Twitter and she re-tweeted a post from [@bangbangcon](https://twitter.com/bangbangcon).
This is exactly the kind of thing I **wanted** to happen as a result of re-joining Twitter and more carefully curating my
public persona!

This only started partway through Friday.  I was able to spend some time on Friday jotting down ideas and just beginning to
extract the connective bits - the **meat** of my jumbled thoughts.  For the first time I also thought that *mind-mapping software*
might be useful.  I'm leaning towards [XMind](http://www.xmind.net/) for the very scientific reason that it looks visually
nicer than some alternatives.  [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page#Screenshots) also looks
reasonable.  But I haven't actually tried any of those out yet.  I'm still sticking to the tried-and-true pen+paper method for now.
I'll probably have to move from my 5x7" notebook to the full-size 11x14 sketchbook, though.

The subject matter I'm exploring right now is in the hierarchy of concurrency and abstractions.  I cover a lot of material in those
two *uber* categories.  Right now I'm working on distilling, re-distilling and distilling some more.  10 Minutes!  It's not that
long!  It's far better to have a very tight, focused talk than a rambly, jumbled mess of ideas.
