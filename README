 Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my personal website, built against `Hugo': a static website generator.
This git repo contains all site content sources, but *not* any of the compiled,
static files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As far as I can tell, `hugo' is the only requirement for building this static
site.  Hugo is available as a stand-alone, statically linked binary.
This git repository *should* contain all other content dependencies.

 Running and Building
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The stock command to build a static site with Hugo is simply: `hugo'.
I'm running a customized theme with my own name, so I do: `hugo -t groovestomp'.
To run a local server to see changes and iterate, do:
  `hugo -t groovestomp server'.

There's a local script named `build.sh' which "installs" the site's static
content to known locations on my webserver, effectively updating my website.
The best way to understand what's going on is to simply do:
  `less build.sh'
But, to summarize, there are two main commands:
  `./build.sh release'
and
  `./build.sh test'
The former will put content onto the main webpage, accessible at
www.groovestomp.com. The latter will be accessible via home.groovestomp.com:1313
