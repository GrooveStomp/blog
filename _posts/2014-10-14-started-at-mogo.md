I am super excited to announce that I have started working at Mogo Financial.
Mogo is doing really interesting things in the Canadian financial market
and I am proud to be a part of it.

My title is officially Senior Software Developer, though I have a lot of
learning and growing to do.

I look forward to working with my new team and the challenges we will be facing.
