      <h1>More Friday - From Monday</h1>

    <p>Wow.</p>

<p>So I just tallied my score and got -1.  I may have miscounted.  We can say -7 if we want to err on the safe side.  Either way I&rsquo;m super happy about it.  My last score was -23  or so.  There&rsquo;s been a steady progression with every game I&rsquo;ve played.  This time I was able to make it to the third phase whereas my previous best was only part way through the second phase.</p>

<p>Man.</p>

<p>The more I play this game, the more I like it.  The theme works so well with the deck building mechanic.  Even though the artwork turned me off at first, it&rsquo;s really started to grow on me.  I&rsquo;ve read that Friedemann Friese is a really weird guy, and the artwork in Friday makes me feel like I&rsquo;ve got a lens into his mind.  I like it.</p>

<p>I also had two rounds of Onirim tonight, and that was really good, but it&rsquo;s a different sensation.  Onirim&rsquo;s gameplay also fits its theme rather well, like Friday&rsquo;s does.  The theme with Onirim is dreaming and nightmares.  The feel I get from that game is a smooth, gentle progress towards your goal of escape.  It feels somewhat dreamlike.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting seeing these two great solitaire games side by side.  I can play Onirim multiple times in one go, but I&rsquo;m not super invested in it.  I think I like it more as I play it more, but it&rsquo;s still a slightly detached experience.  Friday is intense.  It&rsquo;s intense, but it&rsquo;s welcoming at the same time.  I am doing terribly, but I&rsquo;m steadily improving and I can see where I want to go, mechanically speaking.  Despite my enjoyment with it, I&rsquo;ve so far only ever played Friday for just a single session.  Like I said, interesting.</p>
