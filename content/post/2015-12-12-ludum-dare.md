[Ludum Dare 34](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/12/09/welcome-to-ludum-dare-34/) kicks off this weekend.
There are two themes that tied: ["two button controllers" and "growing."](https://twitter.com/ludumdare/status/675495354406592512)
I was fully intending to participate, but I am having serious doubts about
that decision now. I've managed to build the tiniest of skeletons of an
application, but I have so much to do in order to get anywhere near a working
game that I know it's basically infeasible.  This is pretty much the reality
when you have kids and a full time job and you're already doing [daily
programming practice](https://bitbucket.org/GrooveStomp/practice/src). Most of my responsibilities get kicked off to the
weekend. Even then I'm just barely pulling my weight. Anyway, we'll see.

[Chris Franklin commented on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Campster/status/675333485184335872) about month-long jams
that require much smaller commitments of time on any given day. That sounds
pretty good to me. I'll continue with what I have and see where it goes.  Maybe
I'll abandon it after this weekend... maybe I'll continue with it through
December, or maybe I'll even just continue with it until I get bored of it or
decide to finish it off.

It's a tough call.  I get that the point is to just start making something
because making *something* is better than making *nothing*.  I 100% get that.
It doesn't mean it's easy to overcome those built-in walls, though. :-)
And, of course, I see something awesome like this [Space Harrier-esque Pico8 game](https://twitter.com/lundstroem/status/675732199069601792)
and figure *just effing do it* in Pico8.
