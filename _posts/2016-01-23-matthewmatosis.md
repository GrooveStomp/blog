This is a short post.
I really like videogames, but I often find myself lacking motivation to play.
I think this happens a lot because I know there's a serious time commitment to
actually complete most games and I'm not normally able to play for more than
an hour or so.

Well, Dark Souls has been absolutely consuming my free time lately.

I got quite into Dark Souls about a year ago when I picked up a copy for PC.
Since then my interest has waxed and waned until lately where I've been
watching Let's Plays and Guides.

Well, I found an awesome videogame critic: Matthewmatosis<sup><a href="#2016-01-23_ref1">1</a></sup>.
I strongly recommend watching his reviews of the Metal Gear<sup><a href="#2016-01-23_ref2">2</a></sup> and Zelda<sup><a href="#2016-01-23_ref3">3</a></sup> series.
Both are really awesome.  His Zelda series, in particular, really nails pretty
much everything I've ever thought about those games.  He's also got a great
in-depth commentary on Dark Souls<sup><a href="#2016-01-23_ref4">4</a></sup>, and a critique of Dark Souls II<sup><a href="#2016-01-23_ref5">5</a></sup>.
