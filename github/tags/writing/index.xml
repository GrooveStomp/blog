      <description>As my blog has become neglected, I&amp;rsquo;ve had ample time to contemplate my approach to writing. When I reflect on my habits it is clear that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been directing my attention and energy where they could most effectively be applied.
Not all of my thinking has been negative or quasi-constructive, though; some of it has been generative. As an example, I&amp;rsquo;ve really been wanting to write about computer graphics. The scope of what I want has changed wildly from a few simple one-off C++ programs to a strongly-typed Haskell-style rendering and animation engine written in C++.</description>
