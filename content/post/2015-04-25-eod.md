Just finished off the night with two rounds of LOTR:LCG followed by base Onirim.

LOTR:LCG, man. There are definitely a lot of complex interactions in those cards and lots of things to think about when playing.  I know I am underutilizing Beravor's 2-card draw ability.  I guess that comes with exposure, though.

Onirim is nice.  I've won the base game the last two times I've played it now, so I know it's time to move on to the expansions.  I started reading through them before playing tonight, but there are 7 of them!  I was already procrastinating catching up on Betrayal at House on the Hill for tomorrow night's gaming session, so I sure as heck wasn't going to be spending that time productively learning a new expansion or anything like that. :-)
