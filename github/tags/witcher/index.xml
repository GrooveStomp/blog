      <description>Well, I got two more games of The Witcher Adventure Game under my belt this evening. The first game I played was supposed to go to 3 quests, but I quit after two. Man, that was incredibly frustrating. One thing that became very apparent is how little interaction there is among players. This is more of a &amp;ldquo;multiplayer solitaire&amp;rdquo; game than any other game I&amp;rsquo;ve played. I seriously just open a browser window and do something completely differently while the computer opponents play their roles.</description>

      <description>GOG is having an &amp;ldquo;up to 85%&amp;rdquo; off sale for their Witcher series of games. I already have The Witcher 1 and 2, but they&amp;rsquo;re also offering The Witcher Adventure Game. I was part of the beta, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have an opportunity to play it, and only attempted to play the demo a couple of times. I found the tutorial wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly elucidating and just let it be. I&amp;rsquo;ve been curious about the boardgame for some time, but don&amp;rsquo;t know anybody who&amp;rsquo;s played it, and haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it come up very often in any boardgame discussions.</description>
