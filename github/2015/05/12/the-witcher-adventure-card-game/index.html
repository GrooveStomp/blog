      <h1>The Witcher Adventure Game</h1>

    <p>GOG is having an &ldquo;up to 85%&rdquo; off sale for their Witcher series of games.  I already have The Witcher 1 and 2, but they&rsquo;re also offering The Witcher Adventure Game.  I was part of the beta, but didn&rsquo;t have an opportunity to play it, and only attempted to play the demo a couple of times.  I found the tutorial wasn&rsquo;t particularly elucidating and just let it be.  I&rsquo;ve been curious about the boardgame for some time, but don&rsquo;t know anybody who&rsquo;s played it, and haven&rsquo;t seen it come up very often in any boardgame discussions.  It did get a shout out on one episode of The Dice Tower podcast, and that somewhat piqued my interest.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve suffered through the initial tutorial video (and supplemented with the rest that they provide) and have played two rounds to just a single completed quest each.  I like it!  It&rsquo;s not my favorite game, and I have some concerns, but it does a great job of giving you that feeling that you&rsquo;re an adventurer out there exploring to complete quests.  The dice rolling mechanic is passable, maybe even good, but the development cards and everything&hellip;  The foul fate cards are interesting and contribute to the game feeling like you&rsquo;re constantly struggling to make your way, while the game works in such a way that even when you&rsquo;re overloaded with wounds that you can still do <strong>something</strong>.  This is a game where the overall feel is greater than the sum of its parts.  I&rsquo;m no expert yet and I don&rsquo;t understand all the various bits and pieces, but I like what I&rsquo;ve seen so far.  I&rsquo;m really curious if Daniela will enjoy it or not.  I can see it being a game we play out, but whether it&rsquo;s successful depends on so many subtleties.</p>
