      <h1>Proposing a Talk for !!Con</h1>
      <span class="date">2014-03-09</span>
    </div>
    <p>I am writing a proposal for a 10 minute &ldquo;lightning talk&rdquo; at <a href="http://bangbangcon.com/">!!Con</a>.
I feel like this is a relatively <em>normal</em> thing that <strong>shouldn&rsquo;t</strong> warrant any special writing.
But there are a couple of things that make it a very standout <em>thing</em> for me.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>It is in New York.</em>
Dee is super excited about the possibility of visiting New York.  I&rsquo;ve never been before.  What an excellent excuse to go visit!</p></li>

<li><p><em>I have never publicly spoken.</em>
I get nervous in groups larger than around 10 people, and I suspect !!Con will be far larger than that.  Still, it&rsquo;s something
I&rsquo;ve been interested in doing for years!</p></li>

<li><p><em>I get to formalize my thinking on any topic of my interest.</em>
I&rsquo;m in the process of doing this now - jotting down ideas, trying to tease out the common threads and ultimately just
writing a focused, interesting talk.  I&rsquo;ll try to use funny pictures, too.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I found out about this whole thing because I follow <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">@b0rk</a> on Twitter and she re-tweeted a post from <a href="https://twitter.com/bangbangcon">@bangbangcon</a>.
This is exactly the kind of thing I <strong>wanted</strong> to happen as a result of re-joining Twitter and more carefully curating my
public persona!</p>

<p>This only started partway through Friday.  I was able to spend some time on Friday jotting down ideas and just beginning to
extract the connective bits - the <strong>meat</strong> of my jumbled thoughts.  For the first time I also thought that <em>mind-mapping software</em>
might be useful.  I&rsquo;m leaning towards <a href="http://www.xmind.net/">XMind</a> for the very scientific reason that it looks visually
nicer than some alternatives.  <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page#Screenshots">FreeMind</a> also looks
reasonable.  But I haven&rsquo;t actually tried any of those out yet.  I&rsquo;m still sticking to the tried-and-true pen+paper method for now.
I&rsquo;ll probably have to move from my 5x7&rdquo; notebook to the full-size 11x14 sketchbook, though.</p>

<p>The subject matter I&rsquo;m exploring right now is in the hierarchy of concurrency and abstractions.  I cover a lot of material in those
two <em>uber</em> categories.  Right now I&rsquo;m working on distilling, re-distilling and distilling some more.  10 Minutes!  It&rsquo;s not that
long!  It&rsquo;s far better to have a very tight, focused talk than a rambly, jumbled mess of ideas.</p>
