    I sprung for my own personal copies of Race for the Galaxy and Patchwork today. I sneakily jammed them into my boardgaming shelf in broad daylight, with the wrapping still on. Being the suave husband that I am, I also didn&rsquo;t mention a word to Dee. Well, after dinner she found her way into the den and noticed the shiny new wrap on several games on the wall. The jig is up!

    Race for the Galaxy gets a lot of flack for its iconography. I think most of this flack is undeserved. The iconography on the cards is there to prevent players having to frequently refer to the rulebook. Most of the icons are very intuitive, and the ones that aren&rsquo;t are accompanied by a descriptive block of text which typically immediately elucidates the meaning of said icons.
Dee and I had guests over last night for boardgaming.

    I recently built a custom deck to take me through the first scenario. It worked wonderfully that first shot, and that felt great; though I was a little surprised it worked as well as it did. Tonight I gave it a second test drive and definitely ran into some kinks.
My selection algorithm for pulling cards from various spheres of influence was to simply go for all the low-cost ones. Everything 0 or 1 point got scooped up.

    Just finished off the night with two rounds of LOTR:LCG followed by base Onirim.
LOTR:LCG, man. There are definitely a lot of complex interactions in those cards and lots of things to think about when playing. I know I am underutilizing Beravor&rsquo;s 2-card draw ability. I guess that comes with exposure, though.
Onirim is nice. I&rsquo;ve won the base game the last two times I&rsquo;ve played it now, so I know it&rsquo;s time to move on to the expansions.

    One of the greatest names in boardgaming history. Go on, just say it out loud to yourself a few times.
I ordered this game based mostly off of a reddit comment which suggested this was one of the best dice games out there. The reason I even read that comment was because I was riding high off of Pandemic: The Cure and was looking for another dice game to tempt Dee with.

    Being the sophisticated gamer that I am, I&rsquo;m constantly on the lookout for new games to pick up. There are all kinds of games for all types of situations. A very brief overview of what has been on my mind in the past couple months goes like this:  Games with proper solitaire modes Games that play well with two Gateway games Deckbuilders  In the last week or so I&rsquo;ve really started thinking about games that support 4+ players for those times when we invite guests over specifically for boardgaming.

    Wow. Okay, so that was a completely different experience.
I&rsquo;ve played a total of five times now, I believe. I have a reasonable understanding of the mechanics of the game, and of what various cards do. I haven&rsquo;t been getting much luck with the prebuilt decks I&rsquo;ve tried (either custom or part of the core set), so I figured I might as well just try my own thing. Even more than that, I threw caution to the wind and went for something that IÂ think I read as being uncouth: a 3-faction deck.

    Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, a.k.a Lord of the Rings: LCG, a.k.a LOTR:LCG - which is how I&rsquo;ll refer to it from now on.
This game&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know about it. I was really excited to get my copy after having read a lot about how it&rsquo;s a great game to play solo. One thing you&rsquo;re not told is how the core set isn&rsquo;t very good for solo play, and how only one of the three included missions is even beatable if you play solo.

    From the Reddit thread.
Here&rsquo;s a copy of my post there:  D&amp;D Dice Masters, Bang! The Dice Game, Race for the Galaxy (Keldon&rsquo;s AI), Shadowrun Crosssfire, Escape
Dice Masters: Battle for Faerun: My wife does not like this game at all, but all my gamer friends love it. I&rsquo;ve learned that the way I play would benefit most from multiple copies of the starter set instead of getting any boosters.

Not a lot to see here. I pursued a strategy involving a combination of production and exploration. Hopefully the first in a complex and long-lasting relationship. :-)
