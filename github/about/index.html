  <h1>About</h1>
  

<p>I write cloud applications and developer tools.  I entered the industry due to
my enthusiasm for computer games and 3d graphics.  These days I&rsquo;m writing server
side applications in high level scripting languages and the tools to assist in
maintaining them.</p>

<p>I have been a programming language enthusiast, having played with:
(* indicates I have been compensated for it.)</p>

<ul>
<li>ActionScript*</li>
<li>Bash</li>
<li>C</li>
<li>C++*</li>
<li>Clojure*</li>
<li>Common Lisp</li>
<li>Emacs Lisp</li>
<li>Factor</li>
<li>Go*</li>
<li>Haskell*</li>
<li>Java*</li>
<li>Javascript*</li>
<li>Lua</li>
<li>PHP*</li>
<li>Perl*</li>
<li>Prolog</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Ruby*</li>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>Scala*</li>
<li>SQL*</li>
<li>Scheme</li>
<li>Vimscript</li>
</ul>

<p>I would summarize my thoughts as:</p>

<ul>
<li>I wish I could use Haskell all the time.</li>
<li>I will use C for things where I must (ie., the Linux kernel), and sometimes for exploration.</li>
<li>I will shift my career to focus on Go as my professional lingua franca.</li>
<li>Ruby is more &ldquo;consistent&rdquo; and &ldquo;nicer&rdquo; than Python, but I would pick Python any day.</li>
<li>Anything other than Java that runs on the JVM isn&rsquo;t worth seriously considering.</li>
<li>Java favors configuration and tools over programming.</li>
<li>Stack-based languages (Factor, Forth) are elegant.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a strong personal interest in libre hardware and software, privacy and security.  I am a big fan of <a href="https://puri.sm/why-purism/">Purism</a> and <a href="https://blog.system76.com/post/179592732883/system76-on-us-manufacturing-and-open-hardware">System76</a> for how they are working towards more openness.
I am very interested in <a href="https://riscv.org/why-risc-v/">RISC-V</a>.
I have mostly de-Googled my online life, as I self-host the vast majority of cloud services I use, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>File sharing</li>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Contacts</li>
<li>File synchronization</li>
<li>Social microblogging</li>
<li>RSS subscriptions</li>
<li>Web bookmarking</li>
<li>Code repositories</li>
</ul>

<p>I never use Apple products if given a choice, and I block the Google Services Framework via local VPN on my Android devices, or just root them and install Google-less Android ROMs.
I use Linux at home on a System76 machine with the Intel Management Engine cleaned.</p>

<p>My medium-term goals involve contributing to the Linux kernel and supporting RISC-V ports for software I depend on.</p>

<p>I am very interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">The Unix Philosophy</a> and am heavily influenced by
<a href="https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015">Casey Muratori</a>.  I have found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM&amp;t=27s">Brian Will</a>&rsquo;s videos to reflect well on my own thinking.  Given infinite time, I would dive into <a href="https://9p.io/plan9/about.html">Plan9</a> and live there instead of Linux or BSD.</p>

<p>I build iteratively; start small and layer on more depth until a sufficient
solution has been found. I iterate for usability, maintainability and various
performance metrics.  As a rule I verify my own code as an end user before
assigning it to anyone else for review.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t only code.  In fact, most of my free time is dedicated to non-coding
pursuits.  Physical fitness and nutrition are the two main extracurricular
activities I pursue.  I do a lot of housework and work to ensure my wife and I
split our parenting duties roughly evenly.  I strongly value balance among all
things in life, not least of which is a balance between work and personal life.</p>
