<p><strong>Friday</strong>: Such a great solo game. I&rsquo;m steadily improving, but also not playing it as much as I&rsquo;d like. Partially because of all the other great games out there, but also because it&rsquo;s surprisingly intense.</p>

<p><strong>Pandemic: The Cure</strong>: Such a great game. I recently rated this as my only <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> game on the appropriate <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames" rel="nofollow">/r/boardgames</a> thread. Played it with my neighbor at the local gamestore yesterday and he loved it. Also got a few bystanders interested, and the store owner hovered around for a bit, too.</p>

<p><strong>Dice Masters</strong>: I really dig this game. Got three rounds in with the aforementioned neighbor. He picked up his starter set and I got the fancy-pants playmat, because why not? We didn&rsquo;t realize until after the first game that he was playing with 16 sidekick dice instead of the appropriate 8. The other two games were a lot more interesting! :-)</p>

<p><strong>LOTR:LCG</strong>: I&rsquo;m gradually cracking away at this game, starting to get the meta and enjoy the deck customization. I&rsquo;m on the fence about whether I&rsquo;m actually interested in that kind of game. Mechanically I enjoy LOTR:LCG well enough, but that&rsquo;s really only about half of the game.</p>

<p><strong>VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game</strong>: <a href="/2015/04/24/vivajava-the-coffee-game-the-dice-game/" rel="nofollow">I wrote up some thoughts</a>. I&rsquo;m liking it so far and am really looking forward to playing with my wife.</p>

<p><strong>7 Wonders</strong>: It was good. We played 3 games back to back. <a href="/2015/04/26/some-words-on-iconography/" rel="nofollow">I wrote up some thoughts</a>. We started with 6 and had to pare down to 5 part way through the second game. Everyone felt a noticeable difference in gameplay going from 6 to 5. I chose a stupid strategy (knowingly) for the last round with my 2-stage wonder, and it was predictably not a great round; in fact, it somewhat soured my experience. Note to self: Don&rsquo;t do obviously dumb things. I actually did alright, but I guess it was just the fatigue of having the same person win every round and winding up with the same score every time.</p>

<p><strong>Q1: How much time do you invest discussing and researching games compared to how much you play them?</strong></p>

<p>Lots. I play for 1-3 hours about every second or third day, but I can passively watch reviews and listen to podcasts while commuting or doing lighter work throughout the day. It would not surprise me if the ratio was greater than 3:1 against playing. This has been going down lately, though.</p>

<p><strong>Q2: Convention season is coming up. Do you attend GenCon/Origins/Geekway/Other?</strong></p>

<p>Nope! As far as I know, there aren&rsquo;t any conventions anywhere near Vancouver, BC; and there&rsquo;s no way I can get the whole family down to the states for such an event. I&rsquo;d like to check out something like the DiceTower Convention, or BGG Con, but the cost is prohibitive and it&rsquo;s far way.</p>
