- [Daily Programming Practice](https://code.groovestomp.com/practice/tree/)
  After the first HandmadeCon I was motivated to try a little dabble of
  programming every day.  I have long since stopped doing that, but I still use
  that repo to explore new projects on occasion.

- [Software Renderer](https://code.groovestomp.com/software-renderer/tree/)
  I decided to do a "clean-room" implementation of a software renderer to
  replicate what it might have been like as a graphics/game programmer in the
  early/mid 1990s.

- [C Parser](https://code.groovestomp.com/cparser/tree/)
  HandmadeHero and The Jeff and Casey Show motivated me to start exploring
  making my own language and development tools.  This is the first bit of that
  exploration.  I decided to start designing a new language based on a
  foundation of C.  This is my hand-written recursive-descent parser written in
  C.

- [Personal C Library](https://code.groovestomp.com/gslibc/tree)
  I started doing a lot more hobby programming in C.  C has a really weak
  standard library, so you always end up rolling your own.  This is intended to
  be along the lines of [gingerBill's
  libraries](https://github.com/gingerBill/gb) or the [stb
  libraries](https://github.com/nothings/stb).

- [Config-file Precompiler](https://code.groovestomp.com/gscfg/tree/)
  For one project I really wanted to have a yaml-style configuration file but
  not have to do dynamic memory allocations or runtime parsing of the config
  file to use the data.  My solution was to build a precompiler which generates
  a .c file for inclusion into your source tree.
