I write cloud applications and developer tools.  I entered the industry due to
my enthusiasm for computer games and 3d graphics.  These days I'm writing server
side applications in high level scripting languages and the tools to assist in
maintaining them.

I have been a programming language enthusiast, having played with:
(* indicates I have been compensated for it.)

- ActionScript*
- Bash
- C
- C++*
- Clojure*
- Common Lisp
- Emacs Lisp
- Factor
- Go*
- Haskell*
- Java*
- Javascript*
- Lua
- PHP*
- Perl*
- Prolog
- Python
- Ruby*
- Rust
- Scala*
- SQL*
- Scheme
- Vimscript

I would summarize my thoughts as:

- I wish I could use Haskell all the time.
- I will use C for things where I must (ie., the Linux kernel), and sometimes for exploration.
- I will shift my career to focus on Go as my professional lingua franca.
- Ruby is more "consistent" and "nicer" than Python, but I would pick Python any day.
- Anything other than Java that runs on the JVM isn't worth seriously considering.
- Java favors configuration and tools over programming.
- Stack-based languages (Factor, Forth) are elegant.

I have a strong personal interest in libre hardware and software, privacy and security.  I am a big fan of [Purism](https://puri.sm/why-purism/) and [System76](https://blog.system76.com/post/179592732883/system76-on-us-manufacturing-and-open-hardware) for how they are working towards more openness.
I am very interested in [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/why-risc-v/).
I have mostly de-Googled my online life, as I self-host the vast majority of cloud services I use, including:

- File sharing
- Calendar
- Contacts
- File synchronization
- Social microblogging
- RSS subscriptions
- Web bookmarking
- Code repositories

I never use Apple products if given a choice, and I block the Google Services Framework via local VPN on my Android devices, or just root them and install Google-less Android ROMs.
I use Linux at home on a System76 machine with the Intel Management Engine cleaned.

My medium-term goals involve contributing to the Linux kernel and supporting RISC-V ports for software I depend on.

I am very interested in [The Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and am heavily influenced by
[Casey Muratori](https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015).  I have found [Brian Will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM&t=27s)'s videos to reflect well on my own thinking.  Given infinite time, I would dive into [Plan9](https://9p.io/plan9/about.html) and live there instead of Linux or BSD.

I build iteratively; start small and layer on more depth until a sufficient
solution has been found. I iterate for usability, maintainability and various
performance metrics.  As a rule I verify my own code as an end user before
assigning it to anyone else for review.

I don't only code.  In fact, most of my free time is dedicated to non-coding
pursuits.  Physical fitness and nutrition are the two main extracurricular
activities I pursue.  I do a lot of housework and work to ensure my wife and I
split our parenting duties roughly evenly.  I strongly value balance among all
things in life, not least of which is a balance between work and personal life.
