title: Brief Update for 2016-05-11

I haven't been too active here or on my daily coding project<sup><a href="#2016-05-11_ref1">1</a></sup>.  So
what's been going on?<br/>
Honestly, not too much.  A lot of Dark Souls. I mean watching VaatiVidya<sup><a href="#2016-05-11_ref2">2
</a></sup> and EpicNameBro<sup><a href="#2016-05-11_ref3">3</a></sup> while also playing through Dark Souls:
Prepare to Die Edition<sup><a href="#2016-05-11_ref4">4</a></sup> and Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First
Sin<sup><a href="#2016-05-11_ref5">5</a></sup>.  I love that series so much. I'm not very good at it and I
don't like everything that the games do or that the community is interested in; but overwhelmingly I am
completely entranced by it.

Besides videogaming and family business, I've been doing a little bit of software tinkering.  However, this
tinkering is a lot less on the programming side of things and much moreso on the configuration and setup
side of things.  I'll document these things more in the near future.  Here's a quick summary of what I've been
playing with:

    - Mumble Raspberry Pi Server
    - SSD Nodes VPS for my domain name and to forward network traffic to my home servers
    - X-less Arch installation on my Dell Mini 10 (ie., console-only)

And some things I'll be playing with soon:

    - Much more console-land exploration on Arch
    - Sabotage and/or Tiny Core Linux exploration
    - Linux From Scratch study
    - More electronics (when I get my AliExpress shipments)
    - More home servers
    - Linux Kernel programming study
    - Linix Framebuffer programming study
    - Rust language study

And more family time, more workout time and more Dark Souls. :-)  I plan to write on all of this stuff and I
think having my new setup on the Dell Mini will help achieve this goal.
