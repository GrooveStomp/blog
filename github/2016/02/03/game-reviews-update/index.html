<p>Today is a grab-bag of miscellaneous thoughts and updates that aren&rsquo;t necessarily related to each other.</p>

<p>First off, I haven&rsquo;t been keeping up with my daily programming practice, but it&rsquo;s not for lack of will.
As my last post may have illustrated <sup><a href="#2016-02-03_ref1">1</a></sup>; I&rsquo;ve been dealing with computer problems.  I&rsquo;ve only recently managed
to get a working installation of Windows on my machine, but I&rsquo;ve run into problems with my GNU/Linux distro,
so actual productivity work is put on hold until that&rsquo;s resolved.</p>

<h3 id="game-reviews">Game Reviews</h3>

<p>I mentioned previously my desire to do &ldquo;intentful game reviews.&rdquo; <sup><a href="#2016-02-03_ref2">2</a></sup>  Clearly that has not gone anywhere.
Part of the reason is a lack of desire to play the sorts of games I explicitly expressed interest in playing.
Partially it&rsquo;s a stronger focus on programming and non-gaming related activities as I also described. <sup><a href="#2016-02-03_ref3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>The Witness is out now, and as far as I can tell, it is the epitome of the kind of game that I expressed
a desire to spend time thinking about and reviewing.  Part of all this hoopla with dual-booting Windows
and Linux is so that I can actually play The Witness. (As well as Titanfall and The Witcher 3 among others.)
So we&rsquo;ll see.  I&rsquo;m hopefull I can get my machine into a nice state where these kinds of things can happen. :-)</p>

<p>Going forward, I don&rsquo;t see myself expending a lot of effort on thinking about games.  Chris Franklin does
a better job than I can see myself doing <sup><a href="#2016-02-03_ref4">4</a></sup> and I don&rsquo;t want to put much effort into paying particular
attention to experiences I&rsquo;m not actually enjoying.  So if I like a game, I&rsquo;ll play it and enjoy it, and if it
sticks with me, then I may deem it worth of comment on here.  But don&rsquo;t expect anything resembling a schedule
or consistent practice.</p>

<h3 id="windows-7-vs-any-modern-gnu-linux-distro">Windows 7 vs. Any Modern GNU/Linux Distro</h3>

<p>Just a quick thought on this that I don&rsquo;t think deserves a full post of its own.<br/>
During my recent adventures in installing various OSes in various ways, the discrepancy between a freshly
installed Linux system versus a freshly installed Windows 7 system hit me with full force.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t all that surprising, as Windows 7 was released in 2009 and here we are 7 years later.
Nevertheless, I have a Windows 7 install disk and I have various GNU/Linux distros kicking around, so my
actual experience here <strong>is</strong> directly affected.</p>

<p>Windows 7 by default gives you so very little.  My desktop LAN interface doesn&rsquo;t even work without installing
several drivers for my motherboard.  Once I have network access I have to go grab a video driver to get out
of 800x600 resolution.  In contrast, any modern Linux distro will install all necessary drivers by default
so you&rsquo;re at least in a basically functioning environment.  There are caveats, sure, like a reasonable chance
that your wifi card isn&rsquo;t supported in an obvious way, or maybe you&rsquo;re stuck with open source video drivers
that don&rsquo;t perform as well as the closed-source binary blobs.  Even with these caveats, the base installation
you&rsquo;re left with is leaps and bounds above what a fresh Windows 7 installation will get you.</p>

<p>Windows 10 does seem to address this gap.</p>

<h3 id="3ds">3DS</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been dabbling in various Zelda games recently.  I finished Wind Waker several weeks ago, and I&rsquo;m well
into Twilight Princess now.  I was having fun with Twilight Princess, but the Wii controls finally got to me.
The imprecision is absolutely killer.  There&rsquo;s no point playing a videogame if the input you&rsquo;re providing
is consistently getting misinterpreted.  As much as I like aspects of Twilight Princess (and by extension;
Skyward Sword), the Wii&rsquo;s control system just destroys the overall experience.  This distaste has led me to
seek out other isntallments in the series that use &ldquo;standard&rdquo; controls.  The most obvious method of doing
this currently seems to be the 3DS.</p>

<p>So I borrowed a 3DS from Lucas. <sup><a href="#2016-02-03_ref5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>So far I am really enjoying it.  I&rsquo;ve been playing Ocarina of Time.  I play with the 3D setting on, but set
to about 2/3rds of maximum depth.  I don&rsquo;t think Ocarina of Time is a perfect game by any means, but this
is one of the better ways I&rsquo;ve experienced Link to date.  I really like the 3D effect, too; it makes it seem
like there&rsquo;s a little 3D physical toy acting according to my whim.  That may get old, but I do think the 3D
effect adds to the overall experience, however slightly.</p>
