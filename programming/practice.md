See my [Daily Programming Practice](https://bitbucket.org/GrooveStomp/practice/src) git repo.

This is just a list of ideas for what to work on. It will fluctuate over time.

- Turbo Pascal
  - Get Turbo Pascal running. Requires a DOS environment.
  - Get a Turbo Pascal program building.
  - Look into getting Turbo Pascal running on Linux?

- Turbo C
  - Get Turbo C running. Requires a DOS environment.
  - Get a Turbo C program building.

- "Paint" program for Pico8 as per the Pico8 Zine. (Issue #2 I believe.)
  - Pico8 program to plot points onto a canvas.
  - Pico8 program to support Bezier curves with an arbitrary number of control points.
- Pico8 program with NURBS curves.
  - Pico8 program for NURBS curves with interactive control point editor.
- SDL versions of the above Pico8 programs.

- Custom memory allocator the way HandmadeHero does it.

- Custom ASM program for Linux.
- Custom ASM program for Linux that uses the C runtime library.

- Virtual machine that interprets custom bytecodes.
- Compiler backend. (Custom intermediate code to ASM, then ld to binary.)
- Compiler backend. (Custom intermediate code directly to binary.)
