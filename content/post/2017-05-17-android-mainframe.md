After lunch today I made a visit to a local boardgame store just to see what was
new.  The local gamestore near my place is much cheaper, but has a drastically
different selection, so it's always nice to see what else is available.

There were two notable games on today's visit:

- Agricola: Family Edition
- Android: Mainframe

I've seen mention of Agricola: Family Edition before, so that was neat to see in
person.  I watched a Tom Vasel review of it, and I think I would still prefer to
play Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small.

Onto the other game; Android: Mainframe is completely new on my radar.  A quick
read on the back says:

- Two Player
- Strategy Boardgame
- < 30 min. play time

This sounds absolutely fantastic!

I've read two text reviews on Boardgamegeek, and unfortunately this game looks
like a dud.  I think this is really interesting, because I've been seriously
thinking about Android: Netrunner a lot lately.  It's a game that I think is
really interestingly broken.  I won't go into all the details here; I'll just
say that I've written pages of notes on it and am trying to identify what I like
in the original design.

I was excited to see this two player strategic boardgame in the Android universe
because there seems to be a large crossover with my thinking on Android:
Netrunner.  Things I would have liked to have seen in this version:

- Retain the theme.
- Make the theme far more accessible.
  The theme should aid understanding and make the mechanics intuitive.
  Android: Netrunner horrendously fails at this.
- Retain asymmetric roles.
- Remove output randomness.
- Remove out-of-band deck construction.
- Much more!

A quick glance makes it obvious that none of this applies to Android: Mainframe.
This game is simply a rethemed version of Bauhaus<sup><a

"powers" in your hand.

Bauhaus looks pretty fun, but I think the attempt to theme it and add random
elements probably subverts the basic game. Oh well.  I guess this is good
motivation to keep doing my thinking and planning on an Android: Netrunner
influenced game design of my own! :-)
