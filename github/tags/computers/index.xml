      <description>Today is a grab-bag of miscellaneous thoughts and updates that aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily related to each other.
First off, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been keeping up with my daily programming practice, but it&amp;rsquo;s not for lack of will. As my last post may have illustrated 1; I&amp;rsquo;ve been dealing with computer problems. I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently managed to get a working installation of Windows on my machine, but I&amp;rsquo;ve run into problems with my GNU/Linux distro, so actual productivity work is put on hold until that&amp;rsquo;s resolved.</description>

      <description>My primary desktop environment is some variant of GNU/Linux. The only case where this hasn&amp;rsquo;t been true is when I was really into PC gaming and was operating off of Windows 7 for that purpose.
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been more interested in privacy. One nice thing you can do several modern GNU/Linux distributions is full disk encryption (FDE). I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this where possible for over two years now. Unfortunately, FDE requires the GNU/Linux distro to completely take over your HDD.</description>
