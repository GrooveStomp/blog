A little while ago, [Shawn McGrath tweeted about webrings](https://twitter.com/sssmcgrath/status/669017565360951296).  First of all, I hadn't heard of a webring
before - at least not in a long, long while. [Wikipedia describes it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring):

    A webring (or web ring) is a collection of websites linked together in a circular structure, and usually organized around a specific theme, often educational or social.

This is **not** a common thing in the modern web, at least not according to my experiences.
I'd like to do my part to revive the concept.
Unfortunately, the links here are not to people I actually know or talk with, so I don't expect any kind of
ring at all, hence the plain title of "Links"; these will, unfortunately, be unidirectional links outward.

Without further ado, my unidirectional webring links!

      Dan writes awesome posts about working and thinking as a software developer. For example, look at: <a href="http://danluu.com/wat/">How Completely Messed Up Practices Become Normal</a>.

    <p>The awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/netcoyote/status/674299219461562368">Pat Wyatt followed up HandmadeCon with a link to this website from Twitter</a>.
       Excellent articles on network programming.</p>

    <p>I think I caught a random reference to SSC from Jonathan Blow on Twitter, though I'm not certain of it. SSC is loaded full of excellent, well thought out
       and well written posts on a multitude of subjects; often touching psychosis and the human condition.</p>

    <p>More excellent network programming articles and posts. Similarly to IT Hare, recommend by <a href="https://twitter.com/netcoyote/status/674299219461562368">Pat Wyatt as a followup to HandmadeCon</a>.
