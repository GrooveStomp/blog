      <description>My favourite part of D&amp;amp;D to date has been pouring over resources and thinking up a backstory for my character.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have a long history with tabletop RPGs other than being interested in D&amp;amp;D for many, many years. In 2014 I was lucky enough to have coworkers who were interested in playing, as well as a wonderful GM. We started a D&amp;amp;D 4th edition party.Â That was a good experience, but something about it didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel right to me; it wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly engaging and the game felt repetitive.</description>
