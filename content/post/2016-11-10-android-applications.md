I've been getting frustrated with my computing experiences lately. I won't go into many details here, but my frustration has extended to my smartphone and has spurred me to investigate alternatives to many programs and services I've been using.

Provided for your benefit here is a list of several Android programs I've recently discovered. I'm not vouching for these yet, and may not even have much experience with them yet, but they are here and may serve you well.
