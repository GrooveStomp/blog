    <p><a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/12/09/welcome-to-ludum-dare-34/">Ludum Dare 34</a> kicks off this weekend.
There are two themes that tied: <a href="https://twitter.com/ludumdare/status/675495354406592512">&ldquo;two button controllers&rdquo; and &ldquo;growing.&rdquo;</a>
I was fully intending to participate, but I am having serious doubts about
that decision now. I&rsquo;ve managed to build the tiniest of skeletons of an
application, but I have so much to do in order to get anywhere near a working
game that I know it&rsquo;s basically infeasible.  This is pretty much the reality
when you have kids and a full time job and you&rsquo;re already doing <a href="https://bitbucket.org/GrooveStomp/practice/src">daily
programming practice</a>. Most of my responsibilities get kicked off to the
weekend. Even then I&rsquo;m just barely pulling my weight. Anyway, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Campster/status/675333485184335872">Chris Franklin commented on Twitter</a> about month-long jams
that require much smaller commitments of time on any given day. That sounds
pretty good to me. I&rsquo;ll continue with what I have and see where it goes.  Maybe
I&rsquo;ll abandon it after this weekend&hellip; maybe I&rsquo;ll continue with it through
December, or maybe I&rsquo;ll even just continue with it until I get bored of it or
decide to finish it off.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a tough call.  I get that the point is to just start making something
because making <em>something</em> is better than making <em>nothing</em>.  I 100% get that.
It doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s easy to overcome those built-in walls, though. :-)
And, of course, I see something awesome like this <a href="https://twitter.com/lundstroem/status/675732199069601792">Space Harrier-esque Pico8 game</a>
and figure <em>just effing do it</em> in Pico8.</p>
