      <h1>Latest Temptations</h1>

    </div>
    <p>Being the sophisticated gamer that I am, I&rsquo;m constantly on the lookout for new games to pick up.  There are all kinds of games for all types of situations.  A very brief overview of what has been on my mind in the past couple months goes like this:
<ul>
    <li>Games with proper solitaire modes</li>
    <li>Games that play well with two</li>
    <li>Gateway games</li>
    <li>Deckbuilders</li>
</ul>
In the last week or so I&rsquo;ve really started thinking about games that support 4+ players for those times when we invite guests over specifically for boardgaming.  We have a couple games in that category, but I&rsquo;d like to eventually round it out a lot more.  I&rsquo;m thinking games that play in 1-2 hours (instead of 30-60 minutes) and which are  typically a little more involved overall.  High on that list is Cosmic Encounter.</p>

<p>Back to more present temptations, though.  I&rsquo;m still trying to break Daniela into the boardgaming hobby, so I&rsquo;ve strongly been eyeing two player games that skew towards gateway complexity.  Morels has come up a few times as a strong suggestion, as have Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small and Patchwork.  The last two were designed by Uwe Rosenberg who also designed Agricola and Caverna - two games that are very highly regarded.   These three games fit nicely into the $20-$30 price range, too.  The only complication to this tidy list is that I&rsquo;ve been somewhat enamoured with Race for the Galaxy.  Race for the Galaxy is a little more expensive at $40 (plus $30 for The Gathering Storm expansion which includes a solitaire-supporting AI) and a lot less of an intro game.  It does play quickly, though, and plays really well with two.  When compared with the other games, the symbology on RftG&rsquo;s cards is probably it&rsquo;s largest problem.  Personally, I think the issues with the symbology are overrated.  There are a couple symbols I struggled to really understand, but I&rsquo;m playing without the rulebook.  I find most of the symbols are very descriptive, and the non-regular ones are accompanies by a text box that explains their behavior.  I doubt this would be a big hurdle, particularly for Dee.  I suspect the theme and artwork would be a larger barrier to entry for her.</p>

<p>Eventually I&rsquo;ll end up with all four games, but it&rsquo;s fun right now to be stuck in this predicament. :-)</p>
