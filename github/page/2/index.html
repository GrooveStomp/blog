    Have you ever heard of suckless1? I think I stumbled onto suckless sometime while reading K. Mandla2, though there&rsquo;s a reasonable chance it might have happened before then. suckless immediately resonated with me because of their philosophy3. Their software also looks good, very accurately reflecting the idea of minimalism4; often requiring you to rethink how you typically interact with software to do what you want to do. Sometimes this process of re-evaluation is fruitful, sometimes maybe less so, but it&rsquo;s always interesting to experience.

    Well, today I had a &ldquo;fun&rdquo; little diversion. I started out by wanting to connect a game controller to my crappy little Dell Mini so I can start prototyping some games. Of course a controller isn&rsquo;t required, but I like controllers and it seemed like a small little learning exercise. If you know me and my experience with computers, then you&rsquo;ll know that this didn&rsquo;t go as planned. Also, why would I be writing about it if it did?

    I haven&rsquo;t been too active here or on my daily coding project1. So what&rsquo;s been going on? Honestly, not too much. A lot of Dark Souls. I mean watching VaatiVidya2  and EpicNameBro3 while also playing through Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition4 and Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin5. I love that series so much. I&rsquo;m not very good at it and I don&rsquo;t like everything that the games do or that the community is interested in; but overwhelmingly I am completely entranced by it.

    So, it turns out I like KDE.
I use Ubuntu a lot. It&rsquo;s installed on all of my computers and it&rsquo;s the server OS I&rsquo;ve used at work for the past five or so years. Typically I stick with Unity on the desktop. There are a few reasons why I opted to change: I like to try new things, I get bored, I haven&rsquo;t used KDE in a while. It&rsquo;s hard to say exactly.

    Today is a grab-bag of miscellaneous thoughts and updates that aren&rsquo;t necessarily related to each other.
First off, I haven&rsquo;t been keeping up with my daily programming practice, but it&rsquo;s not for lack of will. As my last post may have illustrated 1; I&rsquo;ve been dealing with computer problems. I&rsquo;ve only recently managed to get a working installation of Windows on my machine, but I&rsquo;ve run into problems with my GNU/Linux distro, so actual productivity work is put on hold until that&rsquo;s resolved.

    My primary desktop environment is some variant of GNU/Linux. The only case where this hasn&rsquo;t been true is when I was really into PC gaming and was operating off of Windows 7 for that purpose.
Recently I&rsquo;ve been more interested in privacy. One nice thing you can do several modern GNU/Linux distributions is full disk encryption (FDE). I&rsquo;ve been using this where possible for over two years now. Unfortunately, FDE requires the GNU/Linux distro to completely take over your HDD.

      <span class="date">2016-01-28</span>
    </div>
    Well, it seems I&rsquo;m making very slow progress towards my goal of self-hosting. The first issue I&rsquo;ve run into is with officially support OSes. I like running Arch Linux, but Arch Linux is not officially supported by either OwnCloud or GitLab. GitLab is the more demanding of the two applications, requiring a minimum of 2GB of RAM and strongly recommending 2 cores. Unfortunately, I have Manjaro (an Arch distribution) running on my Dell Mini 10 where I installed GitLab via Yaourt; but that machine only has 1GB of RAM and a single core.

    I&rsquo;m going to start this post with a little problem I created for myself.
So many computers Let&rsquo;s see here. I have a gaming desktop at home, a work laptop at work, a netbook at home for resource-constrained programming and a Raspberry Pi. That&rsquo;s cool. Daniela also has her own computer, but that&rsquo;s hers and I simply leave it be. Two weeks ago I caught myself watching The 8-Bit Guy talking about the Macbook Core Duo and seeing if it&rsquo;s obsolete1.

    This is a short post. I really like videogames, but I often find myself lacking motivation to play. I think this happens a lot because I know there&rsquo;s a serious time commitment to actually complete most games and I&rsquo;m not normally able to play for more than an hour or so.
Well, Dark Souls has been absolutely consuming my free time lately.
I got quite into Dark Souls about a year ago when I picked up a copy for PC.

    I&rsquo;ve mentioned before that I&rsquo;ve begun what I call &ldquo;daily coding practice.&rdquo;1 My inspiration for this comes directly from Mike Acton by way of HandmadeCon2. Mike said that we as serious, professional programmers should be dedicating some slice of time every day to practicing our craft, even if it&rsquo;s as little as 30 minutes. Now, Mike also emphasized small, throw-away practice, similar to doing scales if you were to practice guitar.
