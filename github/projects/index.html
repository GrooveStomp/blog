<li><p><a href="https://code.groovestomp.com/practice/tree/">Daily Programming Practice</a>
After the first HandmadeCon I was motivated to try a little dabble of
programming every day.  I have long since stopped doing that, but I still use
that repo to explore new projects on occasion.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://code.groovestomp.com/software-renderer/tree/">Software Renderer</a>
I decided to do a &ldquo;clean-room&rdquo; implementation of a software renderer to
replicate what it might have been like as a graphics/game programmer in the
early/mid 1990s.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://code.groovestomp.com/cparser/tree/">C Parser</a>
HandmadeHero and The Jeff and Casey Show motivated me to start exploring
making my own language and development tools.  This is the first bit of that
exploration.  I decided to start designing a new language based on a
foundation of C.  This is my hand-written recursive-descent parser written in
C.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://code.groovestomp.com/gslibc/tree">Personal C Library</a>
I started doing a lot more hobby programming in C.  C has a really weak
standard library, so you always end up rolling your own.  This is intended to
be along the lines of <a href="https://github.com/gingerBill/gb">gingerBill&rsquo;s
libraries</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb
libraries</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://code.groovestomp.com/gscfg/tree/">Config-file Precompiler</a>
For one project I really wanted to have a yaml-style configuration file but
not have to do dynamic memory allocations or runtime parsing of the config
file to use the data.  My solution was to build a precompiler which generates
a .c file for inclusion into your source tree.</p></li>
