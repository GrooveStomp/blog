I'm working on a side project to gain more exposure to different kinds of projects in Go.
This one is a pretty typical web application involving multiple authenticated users.
For data storage I'm using PostgreSQL for it's UUID type and cryptographic extensions.
The cryptographic extensions are interesting, because of things like chkpass<sup><a
href="#2018-12-12_ref1">1</a></sup>.

My project right now is using chkpass for storing user passwords.  Almost
immediately after hooking this up I started wondering how chkpass actually
works.  Let's take a look.

So already we see something special:

Interesting!

And let's look at the documentation for crypt<sup><a href="#2018-12-12_ref2">2</a></sup>:

There's a lot there that's good to know.  A short summary here based on my
reading:

- `key` is the user's password and `salt` is a two character string selected
  independently of user input.

- The first 8 characters of the user's password are used to generate a new key
  that is used to iteratively encrypt a pre-set, constant string.

- The result of the encryption step above is the new encrypted value we store.

This is very neat, but reading this makes me lean towards not using it for
password storage, especially with statements like:

> If you are planning on using the crypt() interface for a cryptography project, don't do it

I understand that "true cryptography" probably requires a different level of
cryptographic security than authentication credentials in most cases, but I
don't like to think of it that way.  In my opinion, if it's not good enough for
cryptography, then it's not good enough for the protection of my users' privacy.
Not to mention, the cryptographic security of the password is fixed
independently of the size of the password entered.  That's not good.

So what do I recommend?

I recommend encrypting with bcrypt<sup><a
href="#2018-12-12_ref3">3</a>&nbsp;</sup><sup><a
href="#2018-12-12_ref4">4</a></sup> in your language of choice and a per-row
unique salt per password<sup><a href="#2018-12-12_ref5">5</a></sup>.  Store the
encrypted password in a regular varchar column.
