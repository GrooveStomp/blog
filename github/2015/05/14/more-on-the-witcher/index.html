      <h1>More on The Witcher</h1>
      <span class="date">2015-05-14</span>
    </div>
    <p>Well, I got two more games of The Witcher Adventure Game under my belt this evening.  The first game I played was supposed to go to 3 quests, but I quit after two.  Man, that was incredibly frustrating.  One thing that became very apparent is how little interaction there is among players.  This is more of a &ldquo;multiplayer solitaire&rdquo; game than any other game I&rsquo;ve played.  I seriously just open a browser window and do something completely differently while the computer opponents play their roles.  They can draw cards that negatively impact you&hellip; but you might as well just draw a random card at the start of the turn for all the input you have as to whether it&rsquo;ll happen or not.  I&rsquo;ve drawn cards that have negatively affected other players, but it&rsquo;s not like I ever chose to enact that ability or anything - it was fully automatic.</p>

<p>In that first game tonight, I managed to complete my quest first, and I was just ahead of the second place player.  I managed to get a few sidequests and sneak ahead.  I had a healthy lead at 22 points compared to 16, then zero, respectively.  I played two more turns (not paying any attention at all to the opponents) and then the second place player was suddenly at 50 points!  I have no idea how it happened, and it was shocking in a not-good way.  From that point I simply got stuck at a location where I had to keep fighting gold monsters as a non-fighter character.  I kept taking light and serious wounds every round, never being able to block or attack the monsters I was facing.  In this situation you just continually lose victory points, and that is probably the farthest thing I can imagine from what fun is.</p>

<p>So here I was doing what I thought was pretty well, then an opponent launches way ahead of me seemingly inexplicably and I end up in a situation where all of my victory points are whittled away.  This was so aggravating and completely unfun that I just sat there clenching my jaws until it was over.  And then I found out it went for three quests!  So I quite immediately and started a single player game.</p>

<p>Oh, hey, you can play this game single player!  That&rsquo;s actually a cool feature, but by this point the game has really aggravated me and the flavor text is doing nothing.</p>

<p><strong>Likes</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Excellent flavor text</li>
    <li>Great production values</li>
    <li>Different characters feel very different to play</li>
    <li>It really feels like you&rsquo;re going on quests and adventuring</li>
    <li>Wounds and foul fate cards make the quest feel like a struggle</li>
</ul>
<strong>Dislikes</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Multiplayer solitaire well beyond anything I&rsquo;ve encountered before</li>
    <li>The amount you can do on one turn is extremely constrained</li>
    <li>A lot of randomness</li>
    <li>Ability to lose everything you&rsquo;ve earned</li>
    <li>Characters feel incredibly imbalanced</li>
    <li>The game seems to be  the reason why you do bad, instead of your own actions</li>
    <li>Very low player agency</li>
    <li>How the hell does the support  sidequest work?  The tutorial does not match what I&rsquo;ve experienced in the videogame</li>
</ul>
There are also several things in the videogame version of the boardgame that are really annoying.  I won&rsquo;t bother going into them, since they won&rsquo;t apply for the physical boardgame.</p>

<p>I will say this: if you are curious about this game, then spend the $5 on the digital version to see if this game is for you.</p>

<p>I quite like The Witcher universe.  I&rsquo;ve played The Witcher 2 and liked it well enough.  I&rsquo;ve read one of the novels and enjoyed it.  I&rsquo;m certainly not an enthusiast, but I&rsquo;m probably well within the target demographic.  I was intrigued by my first couple of playthroughs of this boardgame, but at this point I have to say the game is most definitely not something I&rsquo;m interested in.  I&rsquo;d probably play it if someone else brought it to the table, but I honestly don&rsquo;t see it getting more than maybe 3 more plays, tops.</p>
