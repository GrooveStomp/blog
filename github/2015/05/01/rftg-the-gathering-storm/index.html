      <h1>RftG: The Gathering Storm</h1>

    <p>It&rsquo;s always been my intention to pick up The Gathering Storm if I picked up Race for the Galaxy because of its solo support.  Well, today I completed that transaction and also managed to finish my first playthrough of the real, physical copy of RftG.  I played against the easy robot, and I won!  43-32, in fact.  That may actually be my largest win to date.</p>

<p>It was interesting.  Playing against Keldon&rsquo;s AI sure streamlines playing the game.  It also took a little effort to parse the iconography on the robot&rsquo;s player card.  Not a huge effort, but not seamless either.  I&rsquo;m sure future plays will go that much more quickly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad to have a physical copy of RftG and solo support.  The game is definitely a little fiddly, at least compared to Keldon&rsquo;s AI.  I&rsquo;m also really curious how Roll for the Galaxy plays now, and also excited to start turning my friends and family onto RftG!</p>
