## Personal Summary

I value candor and strive to exemplify it, both professionally and personally.
I have plenty of room to grow. :-)

I am an avid fan of computing history and love learning about computers,
operating systems, networking, computer graphics and videogames.

My current hobby is weight training and nutrition.  I've added 60lbs to my back
squat and 40lbs to my bench press in the past ten months.  I've lost 10lbs and
have gone through significant body recomposition.

I also enjoy programming.  These days the majority of my programming is probably
done in Bash for configuring and scripting my desktop environments.  Beyond that
I'm primarily using Ruby professionally, Go sometimes professionally and
sometimes for hobby purposes, and some variant of plain C for personal projects;
often C99.

## Programming Projects
If you want to see what I've been up to, then I strongly urge you to see my
[daily programming practice](https://code.groovestomp.com/practice/tree/).  It's
not quite every day, but I'm updating several times a week and exploring many
concepts.<br/> For more in-depth work, see other projects listed there. Of
specific note are my [software
renderer](https://code.groovestomp.com/software-renderer/tree/) and my [C
parser](https://code.groovestomp.com/cparser/tree/).<br/> I also have a
[personal C library](https://code.groovestomp.com/gslibc/tree) I use, and I
built a [config-file precompiler](https://code.groovestomp.com/gscfg/tree/) that
I've similarly found to be quite useful.<br/> Keep an eye on [my git
page](https://code.groovestomp.com) for other interesting projects.
