    <p>I sprung for my own personal copies of Race for the Galaxy and Patchwork today. I sneakily jammed them into my boardgaming shelf in broad daylight, with the wrapping still on. Being the suave husband that I am, I also didn&rsquo;t mention a word to Dee. Well, after dinner she found her way into the den and noticed the shiny new wrap on several games on the wall. The jig is up! But, thankfully, I had prepped her earlier in the week with false news of having purchased a $150 boardgame. With the new reality of two smaller boardgames (combined $65), she seemed mildly interested, and probably somewhat relieved.</p>
