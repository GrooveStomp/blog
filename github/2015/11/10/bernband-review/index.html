      <h1>Bernband Review</h1>

    <p>I&rsquo;m drawn to the idea of walking simulators.  It&rsquo;s no coincidence that my first &ldquo;intentional&rdquo; game review was of Proteus.
Modern so-called &ldquo;AAA&rdquo; gaming is full of violence, so walking simulators are a nice conceptual departure.  I don&rsquo;t have
a lot of experience with walking simulators, but I have played a few, including: Dear Esther, Proteus, Shelter, The Stanley Parable
and Gone Home. Even among that small selection, there&rsquo;s a wide variation of gameplay and themes, so clearly this is a broad
genre worth exploring.</p>

<p>To start off with, I really love the visual aesthetic of <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/bernband/34864?comment_page=16#!">Bernband</a>.
I&rsquo;m somewhat nostalgic about lo-fi graphics, but it&rsquo;s not really &ldquo;my bag&rdquo; per se. There was a time when my main interest in
videogames was seeing bigger, better, shinier graphics.  Even these days I&rsquo;m still rather interested in the continually advancing
hedonistic graphical treadmill and like to push my &ldquo;fantsy pants&rdquo; Geforce 660Ti to its limits.  With all that being said, there&rsquo;s
a strong appeal in lo-fi graphics.  I think giving your mind the freedom to fill in the blanks is a big part of it; perhaps it&rsquo;s
even the only part of it.  From a purely technological standpoint I&rsquo;m curious about these kinds of graphics because the burden of
implementation appears to be much lower, and I&rsquo;m a game developer wannabe.  Bernband takes advantage of this mental &ldquo;filling in of
the gaps&rdquo; but simultaneously fails to really push it to do something wonderful.  You see musicians repeating the same too-few-frames
looping animation and other passive walkers just bumble around with barely any agency.  In short, it&rsquo;s kind of a mixed bag.</p>

<p>My gaming pc is a Linux desktop, and that sometimes presents challenges for gaming.  Bernband provides a native Linux client
like more and more games are doing these days. Just take a look at <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/search/#sort_by=_ASC&amp;tags=-1&amp;category1=998&amp;os=linux&amp;page=1">the list of Linux-compatible games on Steam</a>.
Unfortunately, my experience wasn&rsquo;t hurdle free.  Bernband was written to dynamically link against 32 bit libraries, but my OS is
64 bit, so I had to install 32 bit versions of libglu, libxcursor and libopenal. Actually, the game runs without libopenal
32-bit (without sound) and this is how I first experienced it.
Without sound is a little boring, so I improvised. I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TvhYjSEd0E">Bernband trailer</a>
and then looped the music from that trailer, also known as <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/564892">Habits by DJShrike</a>.
This was actually a pretty good experience.  After a quick run through, I sorted out the libopenal issues and played with the
originally intended sounds. Honestly, I preferred the experience with the looping soundtrack.  The in-game sounds are somewhat lo-fi
like the visual aesthetic, but also repetitive and lacking character.  They&rsquo;re fine and passible, it&rsquo;s just that I prefer
my experience playing with the soundtrack instead.  The looping soundtrack lets your mind wander and improvise all the sounds that
you&rsquo;d expect to hear, in similar style to how the lo-fi visuals let your mind fill in the gaps.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m specifically opting to review games that are outside of the norm. My intention is to broaden my experience and escape the narrow
bubble in which I live my everyday life.  It&rsquo;s great to absorb myself into the things that I already like, but there is so much
to experience that&rsquo;s simply different. I read books, watch movies and listen to music a little outside of my normal tastes, and now
I want to do the same with games.  This is an interesting experience, because so-called &ldquo;walking simulators&rdquo; are nothing like
mainstream games.  I struggle with Bernband like <a href="/2015/10/20/proteus-review/">I struggled with Proteus</a>.  There is a lot to like
in the experience, but it seems shallow upon reflection.  There are hints of greatness, but what little agency is available quickly
highlights how shallow the simulation is.  I&rsquo;ve broadly divided my desired gaming experiences into two categories: experiential and
ludic games.  Bernband is definitely an experiential game much moreso than a ludic game, but it fails to deliver a particularly
noteworthy experience.  The setting is excellent and the presentation is mixed, but good; but the game doesn&rsquo;t actually say anything
or go anywhere.  It&rsquo;s very shallow.  Despite the tone of what I&rsquo;ve written here, I still think that&rsquo;s okay.  I largely enjoyed my
Bernband experience and would love to see more exploration of that setting.</p>
