My name is Aaron Oman and I am a senior software developer specializing in
backend development for cloud-native applications.  I've been using Ruby as my
primary language for the last 10 years, but I actively practice C and Go as
well.

I program for fun, splitting my limited personal time between weightlifting and
[personal projects](/projects/).

I entered the industry due to my enthusiasm for computer games and 3d graphics.
I work as a backend cloud engineer, primarily in Ruby and Go.  For personal
projecs I leverage C and Zig.

I have a strong personal interest in libre hardware and software, privacy and
security.  I am a big fan of [Purism](https://puri.sm/why-purism/) and
[System76](https://blog.system76.com/post/179592732883/system76-on-us-manufacturing-and-open-hardware)
for how they are working towards more openness. I am very interested in
[RISC-V](https://riscv.org/why-risc-v/).

I am inspired by [The Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and am heavily influenced by
[Casey Muratori](https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015).  I have found [Brian Will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM&t=27s)'s videos to reflect well on my own thinking.  Given infinite time, I would dive into [Plan9](https://9p.io/plan9/about.html) and live there instead of Linux or BSD.
