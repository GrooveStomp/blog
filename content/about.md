  Hi, I'm Aaron Oman.  My online handle is GrooveStomp.

## Personal Summary
- Writing C/C++ since 2000
- Started in Pascal and HTML/Javascript in 1998
- Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science

I like programming, boardgames, videogames, the great outdoors and I love my
family. I am curious about programming languages and have dabbled in a good
variety but mostly stick to C and Ruby these days.  I have always sat on the
sidelines of videogame development and continue to pursue interests there,
mostly at a glacial pace.  I'm currently working on a software renderer and a
C parser. I have an interest in privacy and security and have dabbled in some of
those technologies.

I make an effort to be courteous and honest and to communicate clearly. I'm one
of those people who don't like titles in the workplace and work best assuming
a peer group of nearly equivalent skill.

## Programming
If you want to see what I've been up to, then I strongly urge you to see my
[daily programming practice](https://code.groovestomp.com/practice/tree/).  It's
not quite every day, but I'm updating several times a week and exploring many
concepts.<br/> For more in-depth work, see other projects listed there. Of
specific note are my [software
renderer](https://code.groovestomp.com/software-renderer/tree/) and my [C
parser](https://code.groovestomp.com/cparser/tree/).<br/> I also have a
[personal C library](https://code.groovestomp.com/gslibc/tree) I use, and I
built a [config-file precompiler](https://code.groovestomp.com/gscfg/tree/) that
I've similarly found to be quite useful.<br/> Keep an eye on [my git
page](https://code.groovestomp.com) for other interesting projects.
