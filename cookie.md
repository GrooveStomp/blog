title: A Cookie?
---

I was dismayed to discover that my site uses a cookie.

Alas, it is so, and it does appear to be a legitimate use.
I use CloudFlare to serve my website via SSL and they use this cookie for security purposes<sup><a href="#a-cookie-ref1">1</a></sup>.
I don't use this cookie for any reason, but I also can't vouch for CloudFlare's use of it.
If you prefer not to use cookies, then that is totally okay with me.
I force HTTPS through the CloudFlare interface, so I think they'll just keep trying to reinstall the cookie.
Sorry for the inconvenience.  If it is a bother, please let me know.
