      <description>After lunch today I made a visit to a local boardgame store just to see what was new. The local gamestore near my place is much cheaper, but has a drastically different selection, so it&amp;rsquo;s always nice to see what else is available.
There were two notable games on today&amp;rsquo;s visit:
 Agricola: Family Edition Android: Mainframe  I&amp;rsquo;ve seen mention of Agricola: Family Edition before, so that was neat to see in person.</description>

      <description>Race for the Galaxy is out now on Android1.
This features Keldon Jones&amp;rsquo; AI2 and is the best digital version I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. It translates wonderfully and is easily worth the ten bucks.

      <description>I just finished playing another two rounds of Friday. Just four more to go until I&amp;rsquo;ve hit ten plays and can focus on the other titles in my 10x10 challenge. Even when I hit that point, though, I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking forward to playing Friday between other games.
I tried two different strategies today, neither of which really panned out.
Strategy 1: Remove Low-Scoring Cards The goal here is to remove any negative or zero pointed cards to strive for a maximally productive deck.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t recall if I&amp;rsquo;ve ever explicitly mentioned on here the 10x10 challenge for boardgaming. I don&amp;rsquo;t know it in-depth, but what I recall is essentially to play 10 boardgames you already own 10 times within the calendar year. The theoretical advantage of doing this is less time spent buying new games, and more time spent playing games you already own. What a fantastic idea! Especially for someone like me, who likes to read and research and buy when getting into a new hobby.</description>

      <description>With my last post being on the 13th, it seems as though I&amp;rsquo;ve had a slight hiatus from gaming. For the most part, I would agree with this. I managed to play some D&amp;amp;D and Ascension via my phone.
Tonight, however, I made a triumphant return to form with my first session of LOTR:LCG since I built my foamcore insert. I used this guide for deckbuilding with just one core set and played Passage Through Mirkwood.</description>

      <description>Well, I got two more games of The Witcher Adventure Game under my belt this evening. The first game I played was supposed to go to 3 quests, but I quit after two. Man, that was incredibly frustrating. One thing that became very apparent is how little interaction there is among players. This is more of a &amp;ldquo;multiplayer solitaire&amp;rdquo; game than any other game I&amp;rsquo;ve played. I seriously just open a browser window and do something completely differently while the computer opponents play their roles.</description>

      <description>GOG is having an &amp;ldquo;up to 85%&amp;rdquo; off sale for their Witcher series of games. I already have The Witcher 1 and 2, but they&amp;rsquo;re also offering The Witcher Adventure Game. I was part of the beta, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have an opportunity to play it, and only attempted to play the demo a couple of times. I found the tutorial wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly elucidating and just let it be. I&amp;rsquo;ve been curious about the boardgame for some time, but don&amp;rsquo;t know anybody who&amp;rsquo;s played it, and haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it come up very often in any boardgame discussions.</description>

      <title>Marvel Legendary - Secondary Play</title>

      <description>I decided to give it another go. I played the following setup:  Scheme: Secret Invasion of the Skrull Shapeshifters Mastermind: Magneto Henchmen: Savage Land Mutates Heroes: Captain America, Hulk, Deadpool  I think that&amp;rsquo;s all that&amp;rsquo;s important. The Scheme says to use 6 heroes and put 12 hero cards into the villain deck. This conflicts with Solo rules which state to use 3 heroes, so I just halved the number of hero cards to add to the villain deck to 6.</description>

      <description>As any reader of this blog is probably aware, I started playing Dice Masters a short while ago. Coincidentally, the second Avengers movie was released within the last two weeks and I had the opportunity to watch that with a friend. I am absolutely certain that this confluence of events has left me thinking about Marvel Legendary.
The Legendary games from Upper Deck are well regarded. I first started getting into them either as a result of watching tons of reviews of boardgames, or as a result of being super interested in deckbuilding games and then watching a bunch of reviews of boardgames.</description>

      <title>Swapping RftG in for Dice Masters</title>

      <description>During a slight bit of downtime today I separated my Dice Masters decks back into the cards that came with the starter set and those that didn&amp;rsquo;t. My Dice Masters gaming buddy came over, and instead of Dice Masters, we played two games of Race for the Galaxy!
My buddy has soundly beat me the last three games of Dice Masters that we&amp;rsquo;ve played. That&amp;rsquo;s great since we now know he has graduated well past the student phase, but it&amp;rsquo;s also illustrated some parts of Dice Masters that neither of us are super keen about.</description>

      <description>Wow.
So I just tallied my score and got -1. I may have miscounted. We can say -7 if we want to err on the safe side. Either way I&amp;rsquo;m super happy about it. My last score was -23 or so. There&amp;rsquo;s been a steady progression with every game I&amp;rsquo;ve played. This time I was able to make it to the third phase whereas my previous best was only part way through the second phase.</description>

      <description>I just wrapped up two rounds of Onirim. I aborted the first one because it was obvious I couldn&amp;rsquo;t win, and I realized I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been following all of the rules. I decided to just start playing through the expansions one-by-one and see how it works. Tonight was the first expansion: The Book of Steps Lost and Found. There&amp;rsquo;s a mechanic where you can cast &amp;ldquo;spells&amp;rdquo; that aid you, and I simply wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing that at all.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s always been my intention to pick up The Gathering Storm if I picked up Race for the Galaxy because of its solo support. Well, today I completed that transaction and also managed to finish my first playthrough of the real, physical copy of RftG. I played against the easy robot, and I won! 43-32, in fact. That may actually be my largest win to date.
It was interesting. Playing against Keldon&amp;rsquo;s AI sure streamlines playing the game.</description>

      <description>The reddit thread.
My contribution.
Reproduced here:  Friday: Such a great solo game. I&amp;rsquo;m steadily improving, but also not playing it as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like. Partially because of all the other great games out there, but also because it&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly intense.
Pandemic: The Cure: Such a great game. I recently rated this as my only 10&amp;frasl;10 game on the appropriate /r/boardgames thread. Played it with my neighbor at the local gamestore yesterday and he loved it.</description>

      <description>I just finished my third real playthrough of this highly rated single player game. My score this time? -23. That&amp;rsquo;s a solid progression!  Playthrough 1: -50 Playthrough 2: -42 Playthrough 3: -23  I definitely felt like I was making better decisions this time, too. I also noticed a few spots where I can focus my attention next time.
Man, such a great solo game. A bit intense, though; I find it difficult to play it multiple times in succession.</description>

      <description>I sprung for my own personal copies of Race for the Galaxy and Patchwork today. I sneakily jammed them into my boardgaming shelf in broad daylight, with the wrapping still on. Being the suave husband that I am, I also didn&amp;rsquo;t mention a word to Dee. Well, after dinner she found her way into the den and noticed the shiny new wrap on several games on the wall. The jig is up!</description>

      <title>Some Words on Iconography</title>

      <description>Race for the Galaxy gets a lot of flack for its iconography. I think most of this flack is undeserved. The iconography on the cards is there to prevent players having to frequently refer to the rulebook. Most of the icons are very intuitive, and the ones that aren&amp;rsquo;t are accompanied by a descriptive block of text which typically immediately elucidates the meaning of said icons.
Dee and I had guests over last night for boardgaming.</description>

      <description>I recently built a custom deck to take me through the first scenario. It worked wonderfully that first shot, and that felt great; though I was a little surprised it worked as well as it did. Tonight I gave it a second test drive and definitely ran into some kinks.
My selection algorithm for pulling cards from various spheres of influence was to simply go for all the low-cost ones. Everything 0 or 1 point got scooped up.</description>

      <description>Just finished off the night with two rounds of LOTR:LCG followed by base Onirim.
LOTR:LCG, man. There are definitely a lot of complex interactions in those cards and lots of things to think about when playing. I know I am underutilizing Beravor&amp;rsquo;s 2-card draw ability. I guess that comes with exposure, though.
Onirim is nice. I&amp;rsquo;ve won the base game the last two times I&amp;rsquo;ve played it now, so I know it&amp;rsquo;s time to move on to the expansions.</description>

      <description>One of the greatest names in boardgaming history. Go on, just say it out loud to yourself a few times.
I ordered this game based mostly off of a reddit comment which suggested this was one of the best dice games out there. The reason I even read that comment was because I was riding high off of Pandemic: The Cure and was looking for another dice game to tempt Dee with.</description>

      <description>Being the sophisticated gamer that I am, I&amp;rsquo;m constantly on the lookout for new games to pick up. There are all kinds of games for all types of situations. A very brief overview of what has been on my mind in the past couple months goes like this:  Games with proper solitaire modes Games that play well with two Gateway games Deckbuilders  In the last week or so I&amp;rsquo;ve really started thinking about games that support 4+ players for those times when we invite guests over specifically for boardgaming.</description>

      <description>Wow. Okay, so that was a completely different experience.
I&amp;rsquo;ve played a total of five times now, I believe. I have a reasonable understanding of the mechanics of the game, and of what various cards do. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been getting much luck with the prebuilt decks I&amp;rsquo;ve tried (either custom or part of the core set), so I figured I might as well just try my own thing. Even more than that, I threw caution to the wind and went for something that I think I read as being uncouth: a 3-faction deck.</description>

      <description>Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, a.k.a Lord of the Rings: LCG, a.k.a LOTR:LCG - which is how I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to it from now on.
This game&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know about it. I was really excited to get my copy after having read a lot about how it&amp;rsquo;s a great game to play solo. One thing you&amp;rsquo;re not told is how the core set isn&amp;rsquo;t very good for solo play, and how only one of the three included missions is even beatable if you play solo.</description>

Dice Masters: Battle for Faerun: My wife does not like this game at all, but all my gamer friends love it. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that the way I play would benefit most from multiple copies of the starter set instead of getting any boosters.</description>

Not a lot to see here. I pursued a strategy involving a combination of production and exploration. Hopefully the first in a complex and long-lasting relationship. :-)</description>

      <description>Through the magic of Wine (specifically the PlayOnLinux variant) I&amp;rsquo;m now able to play RFTG on my Ubuntu machine from System 76. Oh happy day! :-)</description>

      <description>I know what the next game I am going to buy &amp;ldquo;for me&amp;rdquo; is going to be. Apparently Roll for the Galaxy is a more friendly iteration of the game. At least Tom Vasel and Sam Healey think so. I can&amp;rsquo;t speak to that, though. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing the Keldon AI to learn the game, and I must say: I am hooked. I started last night and couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking about it.</description>

      <description>I picked up Bang! The Dice Game at Strategies two weeks ago while browsing for Fiasco and Savage Worlds. I&amp;rsquo;ve really been looking forward to playing it since, but the opportunity simply wasn&amp;rsquo;t available until today. I booked a conference room and four of us got together over lunch to play three bouts. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice game; simple to comprehend, plays quickly and offers opportunities for subterfuge. It seems like it would really start to shine with 5 players, and may be best with the upper limit it supports of 8 players.</description>

      <description>My favourite part of D&amp;amp;D to date has been pouring over resources and thinking up a backstory for my character.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have a long history with tabletop RPGs other than being interested in D&amp;amp;D for many, many years. In 2014 I was lucky enough to have coworkers who were interested in playing, as well as a wonderful GM. We started a D&amp;amp;D 4th edition party. That was a good experience, but something about it didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel right to me; it wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly engaging and the game felt repetitive.</description>

      <description>I just finished my first legitimate game of Friday. -50 points.
At one point I understood the game would be difficult, but I must have just glossed over that detail. There may be a little masochist living inside me who jumps for joy at the thought of things like Dark Souls and 1001 Spikes. Certainly I can appreciate those things, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I outright enjoy them&amp;hellip;
When I first read through the rules, I immediately attempted a playthrough.</description>

      <title>A Shadowrun: Crossfire diversion</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve really been struggling with Shadowrun: Crossfire. I love the theme to death and the mechanics work nicely. There&amp;rsquo;s just something off about it. For one thing, it&amp;rsquo;s punishingly hard; I&amp;rsquo;ve played 8 times and lost every single one. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to matter whether I&amp;rsquo;m playing single player, two player or three. (Haven&amp;rsquo;t tried four yet.) The best progress I&amp;rsquo;ve made was playing four runners solo.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of reworking the game.</description>
