I just finished my first legitimate game of Friday.  -50 points.

At one point I understood the game would be difficult, but I must have just glossed over that detail.  There may be a little masochist living inside me who jumps for joy at the thought of things like Dark Souls and 1001 Spikes.  Certainly I can appreciate those things, but I'm not sure if I outright enjoy them...

When I first read through the rules, I immediately attempted a playthrough.  It was brutally difficult.  Mind you, I was being a bit indignant and bullheaded, so part of that is just me asking for it.  Regardless, this time the mechanics of the game really started clicking and I made pretty decent progress.  I got through the first phase and probably a third through the second.

I'm very much looking forward to more playthroughs of this.
