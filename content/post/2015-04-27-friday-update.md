I just finished my third real playthrough of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/182648/item/3594862#item3594862">this highly rated single player game</a>. My score this time? -23. That's a solid progression!
<ul>
	<li>Playthrough 1: -50</li>
	<li>Playthrough 2: -42</li>
	<li>Playthrough 3: -23</li>
</ul>
I definitely felt like I was making better decisions this time, too.  I also noticed a few spots where I can focus my attention next time.

Man, such a great solo game.  A bit intense, though; I find it difficult to play it multiple times in succession.
