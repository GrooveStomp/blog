    <p>I just finished my first legitimate game of Friday.  -50 points.</p>

<p>At one point I understood the game would be difficult, but I must have just glossed over that detail.  There may be a little masochist living inside me who jumps for joy at the thought of things like Dark Souls and 1001 Spikes.  Certainly I can appreciate those things, but I&rsquo;m not sure if I outright enjoy them&hellip;</p>

<p>When I first read through the rules, I immediately attempted a playthrough.  It was brutally difficult.  Mind you, I was being a bit indignant and bullheaded, so part of that is just me asking for it.  Regardless, this time the mechanics of the game really started clicking and I made pretty decent progress.  I got through the first phase and probably a third through the second.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to more playthroughs of this.</p>
