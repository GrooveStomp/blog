    <p>I just wrapped up two rounds of Onirim.  I aborted the first one because it was obvious I couldn&rsquo;t win, and I realized I hadn&rsquo;t been following all of the rules.  I decided to just start playing through the expansions one-by-one and see how it works.  Tonight was the first expansion: The Book of Steps Lost and Found.  There&rsquo;s a mechanic where you can cast &ldquo;spells&rdquo; that aid you, and I simply wasn&rsquo;t doing that at all.  My second playthrough was a very tight victory.  Not tight as in &ldquo;well played&rdquo;, but very close to being a failure.  I had one card left in the draw pile.  I was able to sneak out a win by using a regular &lsquo;ol prophecy from the base game at a very opportune time.  I&rsquo;m liking it so far.  This first expansions feels like the first two or three plays of Onirim where I didn&rsquo;t have a strategy and the game felt challenging.  We&rsquo;ll see how long it lasts.  I&rsquo;d say base Onirim lasted me about 5 games tops.  I kind of like how meditative the game is. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be super engaging, but maybe that&rsquo;s just because it plays so well.  Not sure!</p>

<p>Tonight I was also able to get in two plays of Patchwork.  Oddly, I am missing one of the 1x1 &ldquo;leather&rdquo; tiles.  Seems like Lookout Games&rsquo; website is down, too, so no contacting support for a replacement part.  In the meantime I&rsquo;ve cut a piece of foamboard.  Seems like it should work well.  I quite like the tight-packing nature of the game.  I thought Dee would be excited by it, but she seems to simply be okay with it.  We&rsquo;ll see how subsequent plays go.</p>

<p>I also got another game of Dice Masters in today.  This brings my game count to 15 for Dice Masters - probably my most frequently and most played game ever.  I&rsquo;ve got some more thoughts I&rsquo;d like to share on it, but I make no promises as to when those will come out.</p>
