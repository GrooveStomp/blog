      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting frustrated with my computing experiences lately. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into many details here, but my frustration has extended to my smartphone and has spurred me to investigate alternatives to many programs and services I&amp;rsquo;ve been using.
Provided for your benefit here is a list of several Android programs I&amp;rsquo;ve recently discovered. I&amp;rsquo;m not vouching for these yet, and may not even have much experience with them yet, but they are here and may serve you well.</description>
