      <h1>Bluetooth on Arch</h1>

<p>Well, today I had a &ldquo;fun&rdquo; little diversion.<br/>
I started out by wanting to connect a game controller to my crappy little Dell Mini so I can start prototyping some games.
Of course a controller isn&rsquo;t required, but I like controllers and it seemed like a small little learning exercise.<br/>
If you know me and my experience with computers, then you&rsquo;ll know that this didn&rsquo;t go as planned.  Also, why would I be writing about it if it did? :-)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m running a console-only installation of Arch Linux with systemd.  That should give you context for the following, and if your environment is different then you&rsquo;ll have to modify the appropriate commands accordingly.  I&rsquo;m also talking specifically about using a USB bluetooth adapter, though I just checked and apparently this little netbook has built-in bluetooth.</p>

<p>Before starting, let&rsquo;s assess our current USB situation:</p>

<pre><code>lsusb
</code></pre>

<p>Take note of what&rsquo;s showing.
Now plug in the usb bluetooth adapter and check again:</p>

<pre><code>lsusb
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure the device shows up properly.</p>

<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t have any bluetooth utilities installed by default, so I have to set that up:</p>

<pre><code>sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils
modprobe btusb
grep btusb /proc/modules # Make sure the kernel module is loaded
systemctl start bluetooth
systemctl status bluetooth # Verify the bluetooth service is working
</code></pre>

<p>At this point I had a problem.<br/>
The primary issue is that trying to execute <code>scan on</code> from <code>bluetoothctl</code> would tell me that the bluetooth device wasn&rsquo;t ready.  I had a difficult time resolving it, and started resolving a secondary issue that may or may not have been related.  I noticed in the <code>systemctl status bluetooth</code> call an error message regarding <strong>sap-server</strong> which lead me to some resources.<sup><a href="#2016-05-13_ref1">1</a></sup>
By following a comment on that bug, I was able to resolve the problem.</p>

<pre><code>sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/system/bluetooth.service.d
sudo $EDITOR /etc/systemd/system/bluetooth.service.d/customexec.conf
# Now in customexec.conf:
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd --noplugin=sap
# Out of the file now:
systemctl stop bluetooth
systemctl start bluetooth
systemctl status bluetooth
</code></pre>

<p>Now that problem has been resolved.  But I still can&rsquo;t scan&hellip;<br/>
Thankfully the solution is extremely simple:</p>

<pre><code>bluetoothctl
&gt; power on # This is the problem!
&gt; scan on
</code></pre>

<p>Voila!</p>

<p>Well, the whole goal was to get a controller talking with my laptop which I opted to do via bluetooth and I got bluetooth working&hellip; however, I brought a PS3 controller to try with.  Unfortunately, PS3 controllers use a proprietary protocol on top of bluetooth and can&rsquo;t be paired with normally. See more info.<sup><a href="#2016-05-13_ref2">2</a></sup>  I should have known this already, because you have to connect a PS3 controller via USB cable to a host PS3 system to get it to pair with that system.  Well, luckily enough there is a utility you can download called <code>sixpair</code> that&rsquo;s available in the AUR.  Unfortunately, simply using <code>sixpair</code> on its own isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>

<p>And thus, the end of my journey with connecting the PS3 controller to my laptop.  At least for now.</p>
