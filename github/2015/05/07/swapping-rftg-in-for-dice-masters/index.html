      <h1>Swapping RftG in for Dice Masters</h1>
      <span class="date">2015-05-07</span>
    </div>
    <p>During a slight bit of downtime today I separated my Dice Masters decks back into the cards that came with the starter set and those that didn&rsquo;t. My Dice Masters gaming buddy came over, and instead of Dice Masters, we played two games of Race for the Galaxy!</p>

<p>My buddy has soundly beat me the last three games of Dice Masters that we&rsquo;ve played.  That&rsquo;s great since we now know he has graduated well past the student phase, but it&rsquo;s also illustrated some parts of Dice Masters that neither of us are super keen about.  We agreed last time to give Dice Masters a break for a while.  I thought tonight might be a good time to pick it up again, but I&rsquo;m ecstatic that we used this opportunity to jump into RftG instead.</p>

<p>Man, such a good game.  It&rsquo;s got a great balance of luck, strategy and tactics.  The game takes a little while to learn; I figure we spent about 30 minute or so, and we also played one tutorial game.  This appears to have been sufficient.  Not a gateway game, but simple enough to grasp.  I lost the second game we played, though by a much smaller margin than I thought I would.  The cards were really not in my favor. :-)</p>
