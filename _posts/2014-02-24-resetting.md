title: Resetting

It seems like every blogger is susceptible to a refresh or reset at least once in their amateur life.
Well, it's time for me to succumb once more.

Daniela and I are more proud than I ever could have imagined to welcome Lily into our lives. To celebrate
we've decided to buy ourselves our first home!
All this positivity is the perfect catalyst to start a brighter, more positive online persona for myself.

I'll be working to post interesting, hopefully insightful material here - mostly technically oriented, but sometimes not.
